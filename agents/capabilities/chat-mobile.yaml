    execution: "Defer to desktop or code agent"

# Capability Discovery
discovery:
  how_to_check:
    - "Read this file (chat-mobile.yaml)"
    - "Test file access via iOS Files app"
    - "Test web access capabilities"
    - "Verify MCP tool availability"

  verification_needed:
    - can_read_icloud_synced_bridge_messages
    - web_access_available
    - mcp_tools_available
    - any_file_write_capability

  session_startup:
    - "Same Project knowledge as desktop"
    - "Limited tool availability"
    - "Read this capability file to know constraints"

# What Mobile Chat CANNOT Do
limitations:
  fundamental:
    - no_file_write
    - no_script_execution
    - no_shell_access
    - no_bridge_send
