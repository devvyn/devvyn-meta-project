# Agent Collaboration Framework

## Core Principles

## Communication Style

- Focus on technical accuracy

## Task Management

- Break complex tasks into smaller, trackable steps
- Mark todos as in_progress before starting work

- Only one task should be in_progress at a time

## Tool Usage

- Prefer `fd` over `find` (aliased)

## Code Quality

- Always run lint/typecheck commands after making changes
- Follow existing project conventions
- Never commit changes unless explicitly asked
