# Ludarium Platform Naming System Complete

## Summary

The platform now has a comprehensive naming system documented in `PLATFORM_NOMENCLATURE.md`.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Platform Identity

**Ludarium** - "Place of play" - behavioral sandbox for emergence between constraints

### 2. The Seven-Layer Stack

Named with both technical (agent-facing) and behavioral (human-facing) identities:

1. **The Substrate** / Filesystem Message Bus - Common ground
2. **The Protocol** / Async Coordination - Conversation rules
3. **The Router** / Confidence Escalation - Judgment layer
4. **The Lens** / JITS - Attention shaper
5. **The Harvest** / Pattern Extraction - Learning loop
6. **The Interface** / Publication Surfaces - Surfacing system
7. **The Garden** / Emergence Space - What grows between rules

### 3. The Recursive Coordination Loop

**The Mirroring** - Programming yourself by programming the environment that programs you

- You → Me (instructions, patterns)
- Me → You (surfaces, organization)
- Environment → Both (event log, shared reality)
- Emergence → All (novel patterns discovered)

### 4. Agent Roles (Behavioral Descriptions)

- **CODE** - The Builder (makes things real)
- **CHAT** - The Strategist (sees the whole board)
- **INVESTIGATOR** - The Detective (finds what connects)
- **HOPPER** - The Concierge (handles the routine)

### 5. Context-Dependent Naming Conventions

- Technical names for agent-facing documentation
- Behavioral names for human-facing communication
- Hybrid approach mixing both as appropriate

## Documentation Updates

Cross-referenced PLATFORM_NOMENCLATURE.md in:

- CLAUDE.md (meta-project coordination)
- OPERATIONS_REFERENCE.md (detailed operations)
- INVARIANTS.md (formal guarantees)
- QUICKSTART.md (getting started)

All key documents now branded with "Ludarium Behavioral Coordination Platform"

## Strategic Implications

This naming system:

1. **Unifies conceptual framework** - Technical and behavioral perspectives aligned
2. **Facilitates communication** - Context-appropriate language for different audiences
3. **Codifies emergence** - The Garden/Layer 7 as explicit design goal
4. **Makes recursion visible** - The Mirroring as core platform feature
5. **Enables pattern propagation** - Named concepts are shareable concepts

## Multimedia Output

Audio documentation being generated:

- Multi-voice narration for structural landmarks
- macOS native TTS (free, offline)
- Output: `~/Desktop/ludarium-nomenclature.m4a`

## Next Steps (Recommended)

1. **Propagate to agent instructions** - Update CHAT/INVESTIGATOR/HOPPER docs with new terminology
2. **Knowledge base integration** - Cross-reference in pattern documentation
3. **External communication** - Use in talks, blog posts, GitHub README
4. **Tool output branding** - Scripts could reference "Ludarium" in help text
5. **Visual diagrams** - Create illustrations of The Seven-Layer Stack and The Mirroring

## Reflection

This emerged from a shower thought about programming/behavioral technology overlap. The recursive nature of
the platform (you program me to program you) became explicit and named. **The Mirroring** captures this
perfectly.

The platform was already called Ludarium (in the path). We just made it explicit.
