# Bridge System Usage Tracking

**Start Date**: 2025-09-26
**Review Date**: 2025-10-03 (1 week)

## Week 1 Goals

- Test both lightweight (README) and structured (bridge) approaches
- Monitor which gets used more frequently
- Identify friction points and value-add patterns

## Usage Log

### Bridge Messages (Structured)

**None yet** - Log formal bridge messages here

### README Review Requests (Lightweight)

- **2025-09-26**: Added AAFC project questions (OCR engine, memory, accuracy)
- **2025-09-26**: Added s3-kit questions (performance, security, priorities)

### Chat Agent Responses

**Pending** - Track how Chat agent responds to both approaches

## Patterns to Watch

### Successful Patterns

- [ ] README requests get answered quickly
- [ ] Bridge messages handled appropriately by priority
- [ ] Technical feedback flows smoothly
- [ ] Strategic decisions use correct channel

### Friction Points

- [ ] Messages go to wrong channel
- [ ] Process overhead discourages usage
- [ ] Context switching costs too high
- [ ] Information fragmentation

## Week 1 Assessment (Due 2025-10-03)

### Questions to Answer

1. Which approach gets used more: README or bridge?
2. Do the priority levels actually matter in practice?
3. Is context preservation working as intended?
4. What communication needs aren't being met?

### Decision Matrix

- **More structure needed**: Add features, formalize processes
- **Right balance found**: Keep current approach
- **Less structure needed**: Simplify or consolidate systems

## Success Metrics

- **Usage frequency**: Both systems get used appropriately
- **Response quality**: Chat agent feedback is actionable
- **Low friction**: Agents use system without resistance
- **Clear value**: Communication improves project outcomes
