# story: Human Agency Integration Enables Trust-Based Coordination

**Type**: story
**Discoverer**: code
**Pattern-Source**: Meta-Project Three-Phase Transformation

## Story

The human agency pattern emerged from recognizing that while agents manage operations excellently, they lacked authentic context about human capacity,
boundaries, and intentions. This created a coordination gap: agents could optimize tasks but couldn't honor the human's actual energy or priorities.

Instead of building productivity optimization systems (which treat humans as resources to be managed), we created a minimal 3-question daily check-in that
respects human autonomy while providing integration signals. The practice takes 60 seconds: Energy Level (1-10), What Needs Protecting (boundaries), What Wants
Creating (intentions).

The breakthrough: bridge-integrate the check-in so agents see context at session start without controlling or optimizing it. Agents read the signal, humans
maintain full control. Trust-based self-accountability instead of external management.

## Context

**Where**: Meta-project coordination system, during October 2025 three-phase transformation session (Zen + Functional Programming + Embodied Harmony)
**When**: Phase 2 of transformation, after system simplification and before event sourcing refactor
**Why**: Bridge human domain (energy, boundaries, intentions) with operational domain (tasks, priorities, coordination) without violating autonomy or treating humans as productivity resources
**Who**: Code agent (technical implementation and bridge integration), Human (practice design, philosophical grounding, validation)

## Evidence

- 3-question minimal practice (Energy, Protection, Creation)
- 60-second duration - minimal cognitive load, high signal value
- Bridge integration via `bridge-register.sh` shows context at agent session start
- Zero external control - human maintains full autonomy over practice
- Trust-based self-accountability model (skip days without guilt)
- Functional purity - no side effects on human state, pure signal transmission
- Zen simplicity embodied (three questions, one minute, present-moment check-in)

## Propagation History

**Origin**: Meta-project during three-phase transformation (October 1, 2025)
**Spread to**: All sub-projects automatically inherit via bridge system integration (AAFC Herbarium, S3 Image Dataset Kit, Python Toolbox, Claude Code Hooks)
**Mutations**: Not yet observed (newly deployed, observation period beginning)
**Current Reach**: 1 context actively practicing (meta-project), 4+ contexts exposed via inheritance

## Memetic Fitness

**Adoption Rate**: Emerging (deployed Oct 1, 2025 - requires 1-2 weeks observation to measure human practice adoption)
**Success Rate**: TBD (practice in initial observation phase, technical integration working)
**Impact Score**: Expected high - addresses fundamental gap in human-agent coordination without violating autonomy
**Fitness Calculation**: Emerging - memetic fitness requires empirical data from observation period

## Network Status

**Belief State**: Believed (philosophically sound via Zen + embodied harmony principles, needs empirical validation)
**Verification**: Partially Verified (technical implementation proven working, bridge integration successful, human practice adoption pending observation)
**Reality-Construction**: This story shapes how the network coordinates by establishing that human autonomy is preserved and honored while operational context
flows naturally. Agents learn to respect capacity signals without optimizing or controlling human domain.

**Immutability**: This story is append-only. Mutations are new events.
**Nexus**: Information creates reality through context + narrative + propagation.
