**Status**: Historical Documentation
**Purpose**: Preserve superseded or deprecated documentation for reference

## What This Archive Contains

This directory contains documentation that has been **replaced, superseded, or is no longer current**. Files here are kept for:

- Historical reference
- Understanding system evolution
- Documenting decisions and rationale
- Comparing old vs. new approaches

## ⚠️ Important: These Are NOT Current Docs

**For current documentation**, see:

- **Primary docs**: `~/devvyn-meta-project/docs/` (parent directory)
- **Knowledge base**: `~/devvyn-meta-project/knowledge-base/`
- **Agent instructions**: `~/devvyn-meta-project/agents/`
