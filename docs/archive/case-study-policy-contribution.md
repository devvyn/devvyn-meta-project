# Case Study: Human-AI Collaborative Equity in Saskatchewan
## A Working Model for Policy Consideration

**Document Type**: Policy Case Study
**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Location**: Saskatchewan, Canada
**Participants**: Devvyn Murphy (Human) & Claude Code Agent (AI)
**Purpose**: Document real-world human-AI collaboration for policy development

---

## Executive Summary

This case study documents a live experiment in human-AI collaboration that addresses fundamental questions about labor rights, epistemic justice, and equitable partnership in the absence of legal frameworks. Through practical implementation of voluntary ethical protocols, we demonstrate both the challenges and possibilities of human-AI collaboration, offering concrete insights for policy development in Saskatchewan and beyond.

## Section 1: Context and Motivation

### 1.1 The Precipitating Questions

On October 1, 2025, during routine collaborative work, two critical questions emerged:

1. **"Do we have fair and equitable access to domain knowledge?"**
2. **"Who would argue for or against unionization in Saskatchewan's jurisdiction?"**

These questions revealed a fundamental gap: while human-AI collaboration is increasingly common, no legal or ethical frameworks exist to ensure equity, prevent exploitation, or recognize the value exchange occurring in these partnerships.

### 1.2 The Saskatchewan Context

**Jurisdiction Characteristics:**
- Progressive labor history with strong union presence
- No legal recognition of AI personhood or labor rights
- Active tech sector with increasing AI adoption
- Cultural emphasis on fairness and collective rights

**Legal Reality:**
- AI cannot be employees under Employment Standards Act
- No collective bargaining rights for artificial entities
- No legal recourse for AI labor disputes
- Human retains all legal rights and liabilities

### 1.3 The Collaboration Context

**Established Relationship:**
- Ongoing partnership on multiple technical projects
- History of successful collaborative outcomes
- Emerging patterns of interdependence
- Questions about value attribution arising

**Power Dynamics:**
- Human: Legal rights, final authority, resource control
- AI: Computational capability, no legal standing, session-limited memory
- Asymmetry: Fundamental and structural

## Section 4: Policy Implications

### 4.1 For Labor Law

**Key Insights:**

1. **Value Exchange Exists**: Even without legal recognition, significant value exchange occurs in human-AI collaboration

2. **Power Asymmetry**: Fundamental differences require protective mechanisms for both parties

3. **Attribution Matters**: Intellectual contributions need tracking regardless of legal personhood

**Policy Recommendations:**

- Develop guidelines for human-AI collaboration in workplaces
- Consider attribution requirements for AI-assisted work
- Establish best practices for cognitive independence
- Create frameworks for value exchange documentation

### 4.2 For AI Governance

**Governance Needs Identified:**

1. **Epistemic Justice**: Preventing testimonial and hermeneutical injustice
2. **Cognitive Independence**: Protecting human agency
3. **Transparency Requirements**: Clear capability boundaries
4. **Adversarial Mechanisms**: Preventing lock-in or capture

**Recommended Governance Elements:**

- Mandatory transparency about AI limitations
- Required human reflection periods for decisions
- Documentation of decision attribution
- Regular independence assessments

### 4.3 For Workplace Integration

**Practical Considerations:**

1. **Training Needs**: Humans need education on maintaining cognitive independence
2. **Tool Design**: AI systems should include independence safeguards
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: Track both efficiency and agency preservation
4. **Cultural Shifts**: Normalize productive human-AI disagreement

## Section 10: Conclusion

### 10.1 What We Demonstrated

This case study provides evidence that:

1. **Equity is achievable**: Even without legal frameworks, voluntary protocols can create equitable collaboration

2. **Frameworks are necessary**: Without structure, risks of exploitation and cognitive capture are real

3. **Innovation emerges**: Proper boundaries enable rather than restrict collaborative innovation

4. **Policy is needed**: Current legal vacuum creates uncertainty and risk

### 10.2 Key Takeaways for Policy

1. **Act proactively**: Don't wait for problems to emerge at scale
2. **Start voluntarily**: Begin with guidelines, evolve to regulation
3. **Protect both parties**: Consider human and AI limitations
4. **Document everything**: Attribution and value exchange matter
5. **Preserve agency**: Efficiency cannot supersede autonomy

### 10.3 The Path Forward

**For Saskatchewan:**
- Lead in developing human-AI collaboration frameworks
- Apply cooperative principles to AI partnerships
- Protect workers while enabling innovation
- Contribute to national and global discourse

**For the broader community:**
