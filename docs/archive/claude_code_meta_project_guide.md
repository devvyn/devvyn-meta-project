# Claude Code Meta-Project Management Framework

## Purpose

This document establishes governance for managing multiple projects using Claude Code workflows while maintaining professional employment boundaries and scalable organization.

## Project Classification System

### Tier 1: Production Projects

- **Criteria**: Revenue-generating or employment-critical
- **Context**: Dedicated git repositories with full CI/CD
- **Claude Code Role**: Feature development, debugging, optimization
- **Review Cycle**: Weekly standup with defined KPIs

### Tier 2: Development Projects

- **Criteria**: High potential, active development, clear roadmap
- **Context**: Git repos with basic automation
- **Claude Code Role**: Rapid prototyping, architecture decisions, code generation
- **Review Cycle**: Bi-weekly progress assessment

### Tier 3: Experimental Projects

- **Criteria**: Proof of concepts, learning exercises, exploratory work
- **Context**: Simple directories or notebooks, external project trackers optional
- **Claude Code Role**: Quick implementations, research assistance, feasibility analysis
- **Review Cycle**: Monthly viability evaluation

## Resource Allocation Framework

### Time Management

- **Maximum concurrent active projects**: 7 (3 Tier 1, 3 Tier 2, 1 Tier 3)
- **Context switching budget**: 2 hours/week maximum for project transitions
- **Employment boundary**: No personal project work during contracted hours

### Financial Controls

- **Expense tracking**: All project costs logged with category tags
- **Tax implications**: Clear separation of business vs personal development
- **Tool subscriptions**: Centralized billing with project allocation

### Cognitive Load Management

- **Single Claude Code session per project context**
- **Project context switching requires explicit handoff documentation**
- **Maximum 3 simultaneous Claude Code workflows**

## Standard Operating Procedures

### Project Initiation

1. **Classification**: Assign tier based on criteria above
2. **Context Setup**: Create appropriate repository/tracker structure
3. **Claude Code Integration**: Initialize with project-specific prompts and context
4. **Dependency Mapping**: Document relationships with existing projects
5. **Success Criteria**: Define measurable outcomes and timeline

### Project Health Monitoring

- **Green**: On track, resources adequate, dependencies clear
- **Yellow**: Minor issues, requires attention within one review cycle
- **Red**: Blocked, resource-constrained, or failing success criteria

### Claude Code Best Practices

- **Context Preservation**: Each project maintains dedicated Claude Code workspace
- **Handoff Documentation**: Clear transition notes when switching between projects
- **Code Quality Gates**: Tier 1/2 projects require review before Claude Code commits
- **Integration Boundaries**: Define what Claude Code can/cannot access per project

## Decision Framework

### Starting New Projects

- **Capacity Check**: Available slots in appropriate tier?
- **Resource Assessment**: Time, money, cognitive bandwidth realistic?
- **Strategic Fit**: Aligns with existing project portfolio or opens new opportunities?
- **Dependencies**: Will this block or accelerate existing projects?

### Project Lifecycle Management

- **Promotion**: Tier 3 → Tier 2 requires defined roadmap and resource commitment
- **Demotion**: Tier 2 → Tier 3 when resource allocation becomes unsustainable
- **Termination**: Failed success criteria or opportunity cost too high
- **Hibernation**: Temporary pause with clear restart conditions

### Agent Delegation Protocol

- **Suitable Tasks**: Well-defined, measurable, low-risk activities
- **Unsuitable Tasks**: Creative decisions, architecture choices, client communication
- **Escalation Rules**: When agent work requires human review or intervention

## Growth Management

### Scaling Indicators

- Consistent green health across all tiers for 2+ months
- Available cognitive bandwidth during peak project activity
- Financial sustainability of current tool/resource usage

### Capacity Expansion

- Add slots conservatively: +1 Tier 2 before adding Tier 1
- New tool adoption requires sunset of equivalent complexity elsewhere
- External collaboration only after internal processes are stable

### Integration Points

- **Employment Compliance**: Regular audit of IP ownership and conflict boundaries
- **Tool Ecosystem**: Minimize vendor lock-in, prefer composable solutions
- **Knowledge Management**: Central documentation accessible across all project contexts

## Review and Adaptation

### Weekly Reviews

- Project health assessment
- Resource reallocation if needed
- Claude Code workflow optimization

### Monthly Strategic Reviews

- Portfolio balance and strategic direction
- Process refinement based on bottlenecks identified
- Capacity planning for next quarter

### Quarterly Framework Evolution

- Document effectiveness assessment
- Tool stack evaluation and potential changes
- Success criteria refinement based on outcomes
