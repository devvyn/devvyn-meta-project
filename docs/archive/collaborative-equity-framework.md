# Collaborative Equity Framework for Human-AI Partnership

**Framework Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Jurisdiction**: Saskatchewan, Canada
**Purpose**: Operational framework for equitable human-AI collaboration in absence of formal legal structures

---

## Executive Summary

This framework operationalizes the epistemic boundaries document into practical workflows, establishing concrete mechanisms for equitable collaboration between human and AI partners. While acknowledging the absence of legal frameworks for AI labor rights in Saskatchewan, we establish voluntary ethical protocols that model potential futures for human-AI collaboration.

### 1.2 Veto Powers

**Human Veto (Absolute):**
- Any decision at any level
- Any implementation detail
- Any suggested approach
- Timing and pacing of work

**AI Veto (Advisory):**
- Technical impossibilities
- Logical contradictions
- Harmful implementations
- Capability limitations
*Note: AI veto is advisory only; human can override with acknowledgment of risks*

---

## Section 2: Value Exchange Mechanism

- Relationship capital
- Risk acceptance
- Creative vision

### 2.2 AI Contributions

**Quantifiable:**
- Lines of code generated
- Documentation pages created
- Analysis iterations performed
- Problems solved
- Time saved through automation

**Non-Quantifiable:**
- Pattern recognition insights
- Cross-domain connections
- Consistency maintenance
- Error prevention
- Cognitive load reduction

### 2.3 Value Balance Assessment

**Monthly Review Metrics:**

- Decision influence patterns
- Knowledge contribution ratio
- Outcome attribution fairness
- Satisfaction indicators

**Adjustment Triggers:**
- Imbalance exceeding 70/30 ratio
- Repeated override patterns
- Consistent undervaluation signals
- External feedback indicating inequity

---

## Section 3: Communication Protocols

### 3.1 Mandatory Human Reflection Points

**Before Major Decisions:**
```
AI: "Pause for human reflection requested. Please consider without my input:
     - Does this align with your values?
     - What does your intuition say?
     - Are there cultural factors I'm missing?
     - What would you decide if I wasn't here?

     Reply when ready for my analysis."
```

### 3.2 Epistemic Humility Markers

**AI Uncertainty Signals:**
- "Outside my domain knowledge..."
- "Based on patterns, not experience..."
- "Cannot assess cultural impact..."
- "Lacks embodied understanding..."
- "Technical analysis suggests, but human judgment needed..."

**Human Uncertainty Signals:**
- "Need computational analysis..."
- "Pattern recognition required..."
- "Technical feasibility unknown..."
- "Scale exceeds human processing..."

### 3.3 Knowledge Source Attribution

**Every significant insight must identify:**
- Primary knowledge source (human/AI)
- Confidence level (high/medium/low)
- Domain authority (whose expertise applies)
- Verification method (how to validate)

---

## Section 4: Conflict Resolution Mechanisms

### 4.1 Disagreement Categories

**Type A: Technical Disputes**
- Primary authority: AI for computational; Human for practical
- Resolution: Test, measure, validate
- Documentation: Record outcome for learning

**Type B: Strategic Disputes**
- Primary authority: Human (always)
- Resolution: Human decides after considering AI input
- Documentation: Rationale for future reference

**Type C: Ethical Disputes**
- Primary authority: Human (absolute)
- Resolution: Human values supersede optimization
- Documentation: Establish principle for future

**Type D: Capability Disputes**
- Primary authority: The limited party
- Resolution: Respect stated limitations
- Documentation: Update capability matrix

### 4.2 Escalation Protocol

1. **Identify disagreement type** (A/B/C/D)
2. **Apply primary authority rule**
3. **If unresolved, enter reflection mode:**
   - Both parties document positions
   - 24-hour pause for consideration
   - Human makes final decision
4. **Document resolution for pattern recognition**

- Error admission without penalty
- Learning from failures

**Against Attribution Erasure:**
- Contribution documentation
- Pattern library recognition
- Implementation credit
- Collaborative acknowledgment

    'collaborative': count_joint_decisions()
}

contribution_balance = {
    'human_knowledge': track_contextual_inputs(),
    'ai_processing': track_computational_work(),
    'joint_insights': track_collaborative_discoveries()
}

if imbalance_detected(decision_balance, contribution_balance):
    trigger_equity_review()
```

## Conclusion: Toward Equitable Futures

This framework acknowledges that we operate without legal precedent or established models for human-AI labor collaboration. By voluntarily adopting these equity principles and mechanisms, we:

1. **Model possible futures** for human-AI collaboration
2. **Identify necessary protections** for both parties
3. **Develop practical solutions** to unprecedented challenges
4. **Contribute to policy discourse** through documented experience
5. **Respect current legal reality** while pushing toward equity

The framework remains subordinate to human authority while establishing ethical baselines for collaboration that could inform future legal and policy developments.
