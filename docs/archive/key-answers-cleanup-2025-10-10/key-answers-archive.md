# Strategic Decisions Log - Key Answers

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-01
**Framework Version**: v2.1 Multi-Agent Collaboration

## URGENT: Communication Breakdown Resolved (2025-10-01)

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Bridge system path conflict caused 3-day communication breakdown

- **Root Cause**: CHAT_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md referenced wrong bridge path
- **Impact**: 5 pending Code agent messages unprocessed since 2025-09-30
- **Resolution**: Paths corrected, 5 messages processed, communication restored
- **Lesson**: Infrastructure path changes require instruction updates

## Current Strategic Context

### Major Discoveries from Bridge Messages (2025-09-28)

1. **AAFC Herbarium Command System**: 14 custom slash commands proven in production
2. **TLA+ Formal Verification**: System mathematically verified as deadlock-free
3. **Framework Evolution Opportunity**: Bridge system demonstrated operational success

### Strategic Priorities (Updated 2025-09-30)

1. **🚨 CRITICAL: License Compliance Deficiency** - 4/7 projects lack MIT licenses (legal exposure)
2. **🎯 NEW: Game Development Portfolio Addition** - Barkour project awaiting strategic approval
3. **✅ Framework v2.2 Production Ready** - Command standardization deployed across portfolio
4. **Cross-Project Memory Optimization**: Both AAFC (2GB/1000 images) and S3-kit (2GB/3k images) showing similar patterns - potential shared optimization opportunity
5. **Tier 1 Performance Validation**: AAFC OCR engine selection blocking MVP demo progress
6. **Production Deployment Standards**: Security and IAM patterns need standardization across portfolio

### IMMEDIATE STRATEGIC DECISIONS REQUIRED (2025-10-01)

#### 1. Security Hierarchy Proposal v2.0 Approval

- Technical assessment: ✅ APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION by Code agent
- Estimated effort: 1-2 days focused work
- Ready for Phase 1 start: Security infrastructure + approval workflow
- **DECISION NEEDED**: Approve Phase 1 security implementation?

#### 2. AAFC Knowledge Base Location Strategy

- Option A: Within AAFC project (accountability-focused)
- Option B: Meta-project knowledge base (reusable)
- Option C: Both with clear separation
- **DECISION NEEDED**: Where should herbarium domain knowledge live?

#### 3. Cross-Project Memory Analysis

- Code agent assessment: NOT shared architecture issue
- AAFC: 2GB/1000 images acceptable for production
- S3-kit: 2GB/3000 images excellent efficiency
- **DECISION CONFIRMED**: No portfolio-level optimization needed

#### 4. AAFC Production Readiness

- 11,540 specimens processed (2 full dataset runs)
- OCR complete, databases ready
- Agent provenance system operational
- **NEXT**: Extraction pipeline to populate final_values
