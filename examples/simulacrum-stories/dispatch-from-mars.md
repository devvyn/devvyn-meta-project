<VOICE:NARRATOR>Mission Control had lost contact with the Mars expedition three days ago. When the signal returned, it wasn't quite what they expected.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Houston tone="professional">Olympus Base, this is Houston. Please confirm your status. We've been trying to reach you for seventy-two hours.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Houston>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Martinez tone="cheerful">Houston! Great to hear from you! Yeah, sorry about that. We were a bit... occupied.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Martinez>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Houston tone="concerned">Occupied? Commander Martinez, your bio-signs flatlined. We thought you were dead. What happened?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Houston>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Martinez>Technically we were dead. For like, twenty minutes. But we got better.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Martinez>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>There was a long pause from Houston. The kind of pause that happens when trained professionals try to process something that makes no sense.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Houston tone="strained">Commander, I need you to explain, very slowly, what you mean by you were dead but got better.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Houston>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Martinez tone="matter-of-fact">Well, the hab sprung a leak. Pressure dropped. We all passed out. Then the Martians fixed it.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Martinez>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Houston>The Martians.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Houston>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Martinez>Yeah! Turns out they live underground. Really nice folks. Bipedal, sort of crystalline structure, communicate through interpretive dance. They patched our hab with what I can only describe as sentient duct tape.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Martinez>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Houston tone="disbelief">Commander, I need you to submit to a psychiatric evaluation. Immediately.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Houston>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Martinez>Houston, I'm looking at one right now. His name is... well, his name is a series of dance moves, but we're calling him Steve. Steve is waving at the camera. Can you see Steve?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Martinez>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>In Houston, forty-seven scientists crowded around a monitor showing a translucent, vaguely humanoid figure made of what appeared to be living crystal, enthusiastically waving with three arms.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Houston tone="shocked">Oh my god. That's... that's a Martian.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Houston>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Martinez>That's Steve! He wants to know if you have any Bowie albums. Apparently they've been picking up Earth radio for decades and they're huge fans. They thought we'd never visit because we stopped coming after the rovers.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Martinez>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Houston>We sent rovers as scientific instruments, not as diplomats!</VOICE:CHARACTER_Houston>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Martinez tone="defensive">Well Steve says Curiosity was very polite and Opportunity was a bit standoffish but they appreciated the effort. Also, they want to trade.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Martinez>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Houston>Trade what?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Houston>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Martinez>Music for water purification technology. Apparently they've solved the whole water-from-regolith problem but they're really lacking in the classic rock department. Steve is particularly interested in Queen.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Martinez>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The head of NASA entered Mission Control, took one look at Steve doing what appeared to be the robot dance, and sat down very slowly.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Houston tone="resigned">Commander Martinez, please tell Steve we'll send the entire Queen discography on the next supply shuttle. And ask him if he knows any other songs besides Radio Gaga because that's the only thing he appears to be dancing.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Houston>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Martinez tone="amused">Steve says that's the only one he knows all the moves to. But he's been working on Bohemian Rhapsody. The operatic section is really challenging with three arms apparently.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Martinez>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>And that's how humanity made first contact with extraterrestrial intelligence: through a combination of equipment failure, interpretive dance, and a shared appreciation for Freddie Mercury.</VOICE:NARRATOR>
