<VOICE:NARRATOR>Summer, 1952. The general store in Millbrook stood quiet in the afternoon heat. Three figures gathered in the back corner, voices low.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>I'll be direct. Both of you were in town the morning of the fire. I need to know what you saw.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="cautious">Sheriff Thompson, I already told Deputy Harris everything. I arrived at the schoolhouse at seven-thirty, same as always.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack tone="casual">And I was opening the bar. Didn't see nothing unusual. Just another Tuesday.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The sheriff's eyes narrowed. He'd known these people for twenty years. He could tell when they were holding back.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>Miss Mitchell. Jack. The bakery didn't catch fire by itself. Someone was there. Someone saw something. And I think at least one of you knows more than you're saying.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="defensive">I don't appreciate the accusation, Sheriff. I'm a schoolteacher. I have no reason to lie.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack tone="nervous">Look, Thompson, maybe someone had a grudge. Old Peterson wasn't exactly popular. But that doesn't mean—</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>Wasn't? Peterson's still alive, Jack. Fire didn't kill him. Just burned down his livelihood.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Silence settled over the three of them. Sarah's hands trembled slightly as she adjusted her glasses. Jack stared at the floor.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="quiet">There's something you should know. I didn't see the fire start. But I saw someone leaving the bakery. Early. Before the sun was up.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>Who?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>I can't be certain. It was dark. But they were carrying something. A container of some kind.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack tone="uncomfortable">Sarah, you sure you want to—</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>Jack knows more than he's saying too, Sheriff. Don't you, Jack?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The bartender's face went pale. Outside, a truck rumbled past on Main Street. Inside, the air grew thick with unspoken truths.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack tone="resigned">Alright. Alright. I saw them too. Coming from the bakery around five in the morning. I was taking out the trash from the night before.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>And you didn't think to mention this?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack>I didn't want trouble. This town's got enough problems without me stirring things up.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff tone="stern">Well, you've got trouble now. Both of you. In my office. One hour. And you're going to tell me everything you know. Names included.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Sheriff Thompson walked out, the door slamming behind him. Sarah and Jack stood in silence, the weight of their secrets pressing down like the summer heat.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="whisper">We should have told the truth from the start.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack tone="bitter">Truth's a dangerous thing in a small town, Sarah. You of all people should know that.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>To be continued.</VOICE:NARRATOR>
