<VOICE:NARRATOR>Every Tuesday at four o'clock, Death took tea with Mrs. Abernathy. It had become something of a tradition.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Death tone="polite">You've redecorated. I like what you've done with the curtains.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Death>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Abernathy tone="cheerful">Picked them up at that estate sale on Maple Street. Poor dear, she had exquisite taste. Sugar?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Abernathy>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Death>Two lumps, please. And yes, she did. I collected her last spring. She appreciated the timing—right after her garden reached full bloom.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Death>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Mrs. Abernathy poured Earl Grey into china cups, a ritual unchanged for fifteen years. Death always arrived precisely at four, never early, never late. It was one of the few certainties left in her life.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Abernathy>You know, most people would find this macabre. Having tea with Death every week.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Abernathy>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Death tone="amused">Most people don't invite me in voluntarily. You did, after Albert passed. Said you wanted to understand.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Death>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Abernathy tone="wistful">Seems like yesterday. Has it really been fifteen years?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Abernathy>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Death>Fifteen years, three months, two days. Time has less meaning for me, but I keep track of our Tuesdays. They're rather pleasant.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Death>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Outside, the garden bloomed in defiance of late autumn. Roses that should have died weeks ago still clung to their color, as if Death's weekly visits had taught them patience.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Abernathy>I have a question. You don't have to answer if it's impolite.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Abernathy>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Death tone="encouraging">After fifteen years of tea, I think we're past formalities, Dorothy.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Death>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Abernathy>Why do you keep coming? You could have collected me that first Tuesday. I was ready. Wanted it, even, after losing Albert.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Abernathy>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Death tone="gentle">I come because you invited me to sit, not to collect. There's a difference. And somewhere along the way, I discovered I rather enjoy your company. You make excellent tea. And you listen.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Death>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Abernathy tone="curious">Listen to what? You rarely talk about your work.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Abernathy>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Death tone="reflective">Exactly. Everyone else wants to bargain, beg, or run. You just... pour tea and ask how my week was. Do you know how rare that is? To be treated as simply another guest?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Death>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Mrs. Abernathy smiled, that knowing smile that had survived eighty-seven years of accumulated wisdom.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Abernathy>We're all just guests in the end, aren't we? Some stay longer than others, but we're all visiting.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Abernathy>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Death>That's remarkably philosophical for a Tuesday afternoon.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Death>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Abernathy tone="playful">I'm eighty-seven. If I can't be philosophical over tea, when can I be?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Abernathy>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Death tone="soft">Dorothy, I should tell you something. The roses in your garden— they're blooming out of season because time knows. This will be our last tea.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Death>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>There was a long pause. Mrs. Abernathy set down her cup with perfect composure, the china barely making a sound.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Abernathy tone="peaceful">I thought so. The leaves in my cup have been saying as much for weeks. Will it be gentle?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Abernathy>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Death tone="kind">Like falling asleep in your favorite chair. I promise.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Death>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Abernathy>Then finish your tea first. Seems rude to rush off before the pot's empty.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Abernathy>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Death tone="warmly">You're inviting Death to take their time. The irony isn't lost on me.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Death>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Abernathy tone="content">We've been friends for fifteen years. I'd like to savor the last cup. Tell me, will you find someone else to have tea with? I worry you'll be lonely without our Tuesdays.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Abernathy>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Death tone="touched">That's very kind. But I think I'll keep Tuesdays at four sacred. A moment of stillness in an otherwise busy eternity. In memory of an extraordinary woman who taught Death how to be a proper tea guest.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Death>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>They finished their tea as the autumn sun painted the garden gold. And when Mrs. Abernathy finally closed her eyes, she was smiling, the taste of Earl Grey still sweet on her lips, and her friend holding her hand.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:NARRATOR tone="gentle">The roses bloomed for three more days. Then, having fulfilled their purpose, they rested. But every Tuesday at four o'clock, if you listen carefully, you can still hear the gentle clink of china cups in an empty room.</VOICE:NARRATOR>
