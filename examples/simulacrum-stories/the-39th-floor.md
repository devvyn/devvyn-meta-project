<VOICE:NARRATOR>The rain hadn't stopped in three days. Neither had the investigation. Detective Strand stood outside room 3917, fourth body this week, same MO, same calling card: a white orchid on the nightstand.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Strand tone="weary">You're late, Nakamura. Crime scene's getting cold.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Strand>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Nakamura tone="professional">Traffic. And the victim's been dead six hours, Strand. Scene was cold when you called me. What've we got?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Nakamura>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Strand>Male, mid-forties, single gunshot, no signs of struggle. Wallet's here, watch is here, everything's here except the part that makes sense.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Strand>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Dr. Nakamura knelt by the body, clinical eyes scanning details most people missed. She'd worked with Strand for five years. Long enough to know when he was holding something back.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Nakamura tone="suspicious">What aren't you telling me?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Nakamura>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Strand>The orchid. It's the same species as the others. Phalaenopsis aphrodite. Rare, expensive, requires specific growing conditions. Someone's making a statement.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Strand>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Nakamura>Four victims, four orchids, zero connections between the deceased. Except...</VOICE:CHARACTER_Nakamura>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Strand tone="grim">Except they all stayed on the thirty-ninth floor. Different hotels, different cities, always room 3917. That's not coincidence. That's pattern.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Strand>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The rain drummed against the window, turning the city lights into watercolor smears. Somewhere in those lights, a killer was already selecting their next canvas.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Nakamura>The orchid grower. The hotel registry. Did you cross-reference?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Nakamura>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Strand>Six nurseries in the tri-state area grow this variety. Five have regular customers who travel for business. One name appears on all five customer lists.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Strand>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Nakamura tone="excited">We have a suspect?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Nakamura>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Strand tone="heavy">We have a problem. The name on those lists is Detective Sarah Nakamura.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Strand>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The room went very quiet. Even the rain seemed to hold its breath.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Nakamura tone="shocked">That's impossible. I've never— Strand, you know me. Five years we've been partners.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Nakamura>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Strand tone="conflicted">I know. Which is why I'm here alone, before backup arrives, giving you exactly three minutes to explain why your credit card purchased orchids from all five nurseries in the last six months.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Strand>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Nakamura tone="urgent">Someone's framing me. The real killer— they'd have access to my information. My credentials. Strand, I'm being set up.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Nakamura>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Strand>That's what they all say, Doc. But here's what keeps me awake: all four victims had one thing in common beyond hotels and flowers. They were all witnesses. To cases we worked. Cases where the evidence was processed by you.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Strand>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Nakamura tone="realization">The Westside corruption case. The pharmaceutical fraud. The— oh God. They all testified. And they all walked because evidence went missing.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Nakamura>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Strand>Evidence you handled.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Strand>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Nakamura tone="intense">Which means someone in the department has been sabotaging cases and making it look like me. Strand, think. Who benefits from those cases falling apart? Who had access to my credentials, my credit cards, my—</VOICE:CHARACTER_Nakamura>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The door opened. Captain Morris stepped in, service weapon drawn but lowered, radio crackling with incoming units.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Strand tone="resigned">Time's up, Doc. Whatever happens next, I need you to know I'll find the truth. One way or another.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Strand>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Nakamura tone="determined">Then you better work fast, Detective. Because whoever's doing this just escalated. And I have a feeling we're both on their list now.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Nakamura>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Outside, the rain continued. The city drowned in gray, and somewhere on a thirty-ninth floor, another white orchid was being placed on another nightstand. The killer had just made their boldest move yet.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:NARRATOR tone="ominous">And the game was far from over.</VOICE:NARRATOR>
