<VOICE:NARRATOR>The restaurant had a Michelin star, a six-month waiting list, and a sommelier who was, technically speaking, from Hell.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Marcus tone="smooth">Good evening. I'm Marcus, your sommelier tonight. Might I suggest a pairing for your souls?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Marcus>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Chen tone="confused">Did you say souls? I think you mean sole. The fish.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Chen>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Marcus tone="embarrassed">Right. Yes. The fish. Absolutely. Force of habit.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Marcus>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Marcus had been topside for three months, working at Inferno—unfortunate name, he thought—trying to understand humans through their dining preferences. It was surprisingly effective.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Chef tone="stressed">Marcus! Table twelve is asking about the Bordeaux again. Can you just tell them it's sold out instead of offering them a blood pact?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Chef>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Marcus>I offered them a loyalty card!</VOICE:CHARACTER_Marcus>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Chef>Written in Latin. On parchment. That smelled like sulfur.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Chef>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Marcus tone="defensive">Premium parchment. Very exclusive.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Marcus>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Chef Rodriguez had figured out Marcus wasn't human after the incident with the flambé. Normal people don't casually extinguish flames with their bare hands while discussing tannin structure.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Chen tone="intrigued">Excuse me, sommelier? My colleague and I were wondering about the wine pairing. You seem very... passionate about it.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Chen>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Marcus tone="enthusiastic">Ah! You've ordered the ribeye. Excellent choice. I recommend a 2015 Napa Cabernet. Notes of blackberry, a hint of mortal suffering, and— sorry, tobacco. Tobacco. Not suffering. Common mistake.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Marcus>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Patron tone="suspicious">Are you okay? You're sweating. And is that steam?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Patron>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Marcus>Air conditioning malfunction. Happens all the time. Not at all related to my internal temperature running at a constant four hundred degrees Celsius.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Marcus>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Chef Rodriguez emerged from the kitchen, making frantic cutting gestures at his throat. Marcus ignored him.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Chen tone="amazed">Wait. Are you... are you a demon?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Chen>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Marcus tone="relieved">Oh thank the Dark Lords, someone finally asked! Yes! Seven hundred years corrupting souls in the third circle of torment, recently transferred to hospitality. It's not that different, honestly.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Marcus>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Patron tone="skeptical">This is a very committed bit.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Patron>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Marcus tone="eager">No, genuinely infernal! Look, I can prove it. Your ribeye is medium rare, correct? Watch this.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Marcus>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Marcus placed his hand on the plate. The steak sizzled, achieving perfect medium-rare temperature in three seconds.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Chen tone="excited">That's incredible! Can you do that with the crème brûlée?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Chen>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Chef tone="panicking">Please don't encourage him! Last week he caramelized six desserts simultaneously and set off the smoke alarm!</VOICE:CHARACTER_Chef>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Patron tone="thoughtful">You know what? If the food's this good and the service is this entertaining, I don't care if our sommelier is from Hell. Marcus, what wine pairs with the chocolate lava cake?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Patron>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Marcus tone="professional">Ah, excellent question! I recommend a late harvest Riesling. The sweetness balances the bitter darkness of chocolate, much like how divine grace theoretically balances eternal damnation. Not that I'd know personally.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Marcus>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Chen>We're tipping you extra. This is the best dinner theater I've ever experienced.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Chen>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>And that's how Marcus became the highest-rated sommelier in the city, proving that customer service skills are transferable across dimensions, and that people will forgive almost anything if the wine pairing is exceptional.</VOICE:NARRATOR>
