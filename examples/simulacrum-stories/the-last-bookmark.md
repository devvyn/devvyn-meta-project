<VOICE:NARRATOR>The bookstore smelled of old paper and forgotten dreams. Eleanor had been its keeper for forty-three years, and today would be her last.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor tone="wistful">You're early. I don't close for another hour.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Book tone="gentle">I wanted to say goodbye properly. Before the others arrive.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Book>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Most people would find it strange, having a conversation with a book. But Eleanor had learned long ago that books talk to those who truly listen.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>How long have you been on that shelf? Thirty years?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Book>Thirty-two. I watched you paint over the water stain on the ceiling. Twice. I was there when your daughter was born. You read me that night, in the back room, while waiting for your husband to call.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Book>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor tone="sad">I never sold you. Couldn't bring myself to.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Book>Because I'm not meant to be sold. I'm meant to be kept. Some books are like that. We're bookmarks in people's lives.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Book>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Eleanor ran her fingers along the spine, feeling the familiar crack in the binding, the water damage from that flood in ninety-seven.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>What happens to bookmarks when the chapter ends?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Book tone="warm">They move to the next chapter. You're not ending, Eleanor. You're just being shelved somewhere else for a while.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Book>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor tone="tearful">I'm scared. Of being forgotten. Of all these stories disappearing.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Book>Stories don't disappear. They change hands. They find new readers. Your granddaughter will open this shop tomorrow with fresh eyes and old love. The stories continue.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Book>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Through the window, the sun set over the neighborhood Eleanor had served for four decades. One by one, the street lights flickered on.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>Will you talk to her? My granddaughter?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Book>If she listens. Not everyone can hear us. But she has your eyes. I think she'll learn.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Book>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor tone="accepting">Then I suppose this isn't goodbye. Just... until the next chapter.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Book>Until the next chapter. And Eleanor? Thank you for being our keeper.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Book>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Eleanor locked the door for the last time, but left a single light burning in the window. Some stories, after all, are never truly finished. They're just waiting for someone new to pick up where the bookmark was left.</VOICE:NARRATOR>
