<VOICE:NARRATOR>The lighthouse stood alone against the darkening sky, its beam cutting through the gathering fog. Three figures climbed the spiral stairs, their footsteps echoing in the confined space.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Morgan tone="determined">The logs end three days ago. Right here. Just stops mid-sentence.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Morgan>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Reeves tone="skeptical">Morgan, lighthouse keepers take breaks. Maybe he went to the mainland for supplies.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Reeves>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Chen tone="observant">His coffee's still warm. And look at this handwriting. See how it gets more erratic toward the end?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Chen>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Dr. Chen held the logbook up to the lamp. The final entry, dated three days prior, read simply: "They're not birds. Counted seventeen. Coming closer."</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Morgan>Not birds. What's that supposed to mean?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Morgan>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Reeves tone="uneasy">Could be drones. Tech companies test coastal surveillance equipment out here. I've seen the permits.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Reeves>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Chen>Seventeen drones hovering near a lighthouse for days would make the news, Detective. This is something else.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Chen>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Morgan walked to the window, peering out into the fog. The beam rotated, illuminating nothing but gray emptiness. Then, for just a moment, seventeen dark shapes passed through the light.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Morgan tone="alarmed">There! Did you see that?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Morgan>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Reeves>See what? I didn't see anything.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Reeves>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Chen tone="intense">I saw them. Seventeen. Just like he wrote. They're in formation.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Chen>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The radio crackled to life. Static, then a voice, distant and distorted.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Reeves tone="startled">That's impossible. The lighthouse keeper's radio only transmits, it doesn't receive. It's been broken for months.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Reeves>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Morgan>What's it saying?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Morgan>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>They fell silent, listening. Through the static came a rhythmic pattern. Not words. Not morse code. Something else entirely. Something that matched the rotation of the lighthouse beam.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Chen tone="realization">It's responding to the light. The pattern changes every time the beam completes a rotation.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Chen>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Reeves tone="commanding">We need to leave. Now. This is beyond our jurisdiction.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Reeves>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Morgan>The keeper's still out there somewhere. We can't just leave.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Morgan>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The beam rotated again. This time, all three saw them clearly. Seventeen shapes, hovering in perfect geometric formation, descending slowly through the fog toward the lighthouse.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Chen tone="whisper">They're not getting closer. We are. The lighthouse is rising.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Chen>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>And in that moment, they understood. The lighthouse keeper hadn't left. He'd simply written his last observation before the structure began its ascent, carrying him up into whatever waited in the clouds above.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:NARRATOR tone="ominous">The logbook fell from Morgan's hands as the first shadow passed through the window.</VOICE:NARRATOR>
