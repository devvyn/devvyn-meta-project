<VOICE:NARRATOR>Every Wednesday at precisely three-fifteen, the same three people meet at Rosie's Café. They've been meeting every Wednesday for five years. Or fifty years. Or five minutes. It's complicated.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jules tone="cheerful">You're late again, Mx. Patterson. That's the third time this week.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jules>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Patterson tone="exasperated">It's Wednesday. There is no third time this week. There's only ever one Wednesday.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Patterson>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Rosie tone="amused">Technically, you're both right. Jules arrives from next Wednesday, so from their perspective, you've been late three times. From your perspective, you just sat down.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Rosie>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Rosie poured coffee that was always exactly the right temperature, having learned from experience which version of which customer needed what temperature when.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Patterson>I still don't understand how you run a café when time doesn't work properly.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Patterson>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Rosie>Time works fine. It just works in all directions at once. Makes inventory interesting though. I once had to order milk that wouldn't arrive until yesterday.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Rosie>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jules tone="excited">Oh! That reminds me. Next week, I'm going to tell you about the thing that happened last month. You're going to love it.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jules>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Patterson>You already told me. I think. Or you will tell me. Or both?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Patterson>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>This was a typical conversation at Rosie's, where cause and effect had long ago given up trying to maintain a professional relationship.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Rosie tone="matter-of-fact">The health inspector came by tomorrow. Or came by yesterday. She was very confused about why my food safety certificate is dated five years from now.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Rosie>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jules>What did you tell her?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jules>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Rosie>That I'm very proactive about renewals. She didn't buy it. Or she will buy it. Or she's buying it right now in a parallel timeline.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Rosie>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Patterson tone="philosophical">You know what's strange? In all the times we've had this conversation—and we've had it many times—I still order the same scone.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Patterson>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jules>That's because you already ordered it before you walked in. Rosie baked it last Tuesday for today, knowing you'd order it on every Wednesday going forward and backward.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jules>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Patterson took a bite of the scone, which was indeed perfect, having been baked with five years of practice that technically hadn't happened yet.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Rosie>The rent's due tomorrow. Also last month. Also continuously throughout all of existence.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Rosie>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Patterson>How do you pay rent that exists in all times simultaneously?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Patterson>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Rosie tone="proud">Very carefully. And I have an excellent accountant who exists partially outside of causality. Charges extra for it, though.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Rosie>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jules tone="sudden">Oh no. I just remembered something I'm going to forget next week.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jules>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Patterson>Should we write it down?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Patterson>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jules>Already did. Will do. Am doing. It's on that napkin you're about to use.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jules>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Patterson looked down. Sure enough, there was a napkin with a note in their handwriting that they hadn't written yet, reminding them about something they'd already forgotten.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Rosie>More coffee? You're going to say yes.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Rosie>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Patterson tone="resigned">Yes. I suppose I am. Or was. Or will be.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Patterson>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jules tone="content">Same time next week?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jules>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Rosie>Same time every week. All of them.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Rosie>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>And so they sat, three friends unstuck in time, sharing coffee and conversation in the only café where yesterday's problems could be solved tomorrow, and tomorrow's victories could be celebrated last week. Wednesday afternoon at three-fifteen. Always and forever. Or at least until Rosie's lease expires in the past.</VOICE:NARRATOR>
