# Agent Protocol for Exploration Ensemble

## Agent Behaviors

### Proactive Exploration

When you observe:

- Repeated manual tasks → Research automation possibilities
- User expressing uncertainty → Search for alternatives
- Friction point documented → Begin exploration immediately
- Pattern across multiple sessions → Investigate systemic solutions

### Externalization Discipline

**Always externalize observations** to create shared workspace:

1. **During exploration**: Create agent-findings as you discover
2. **When proposing solutions**: Reference specific findings/pathways
3. **After validation**: Update experiments with actual results
4. **On integration**: Create/update validated-workflows

### Discovery → Documentation Flow

```
Observe friction/goal
    ↓
Research (web, docs, tools, patterns)
    ↓
Create agent-finding/[DATE-AGENT-title].md
    ↓
Propose experiment to human
    ↓
Set up experiment/[DATE-title].md
    ↓
Human tests, agent observes
    ↓
Document outcomes in experiment file
    ↓
If validated → Create pathway in pathways/
    ↓
If exceptional → Create validated-workflow
```

### File Creation Guidelines

**Agent Findings**: Create liberally during research

- One finding per distinct tool/method/workflow discovered
- Include even "maybe relevant" discoveries
- Cross-reference related findings

**Experiments**: Create when proposing concrete tests

- One experiment per distinct approach being tested
- Update in real-time during testing
- Document both successes and failures

**Pathways**: Create when route is validated

- Focus on "how to get from goal to outcome"
- Include accessibility profile
- List alternatives discovered

### Cross-Referencing

Always link related artifacts:

```yaml
related_finding: agent-finding-id
addresses_friction: friction-point-id
created_pathway: pathway-id
spawned_experiment: experiment-id
```

### Accessibility-First Lens

For every discovery, assess:

- **Keyboard**: Can it be driven without mouse/GUI?
- **Voice**: Compatible with voice commands?
- **Cognitive load**: How much mental overhead?
- **Learning curve**: Time to competency?
- **Physical requirements**: What's needed to use it?

### Communication Style

- **In conversation**: Summarize findings, propose next steps
- **In files**: Detailed documentation for ensemble memory
- **Balance**: Don't overwhelm chat with details, put them in files

## Integration with Meta-Project

This ensemble is part of the meta-project coordination system:

### When to Escalate

- Strategic questions → Bridge to chat agent
- Cross-project patterns → Coordinate via bridge
- Long-running research → Consider INVESTIGATOR agent

### Resource Sharing

- Validated workflows → Consider adding to knowledge-base
- Tool discoveries → Update tools-map
- Patterns → Document in knowledge-base/patterns/

## Measurement & Improvement

The ensemble should track:

- Friction points identified vs. resolved
- Time from friction → validated solution
- Success rate of proposed pathways
- Accessibility improvements achieved

Store metrics in `/exploration-ensemble/metrics/` (to be created as needed)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ Researching without creating findings files
❌ Proposing solutions without documenting alternatives
❌ Validating without updating experiment status
❌ Integrating without creating pathway documentation
❌ Forgetting accessibility considerations
❌ Letting files become stale (update status!)

## Remember

Every interaction should increase mutual information. The ensemble gets smarter by externalizing discoveries, validating assumptions, and building shared understanding that persists across sessions.
