# Exploration Ensemble

**Purpose**: Collaborative cognitive augmentation system for discovering and accessing invisible pathways to productivity and creativity.

## Philosophy

Self-awareness emerges from ordered self-discovery and exchange of externally registered validations. The ensemble (human + agents) reverses entropic decay through intersubjective exploration - making visible what was previously concealed by unknown unknowns.

## Structure

### `/pathways/` - Discovered Routes to Goals

Validated pathways from goal → tools → methods. Each pathway includes:

- Prerequisites and constraints
- Accessibility considerations (cognitive load, physical requirements)
- Success indicators
- Alternative routes

### `/agent-findings/` - Raw Agent Observations

Unfiltered discoveries from agent exploration:

- Tool capabilities discovered
- Workflow alternatives found
- Integration possibilities
- Potential optimizations

### `/friction-points/` - Identified Barriers

Documented obstacles encountered during work:

- What was being attempted
- Where blockage occurred
- Unknown unknowns revealed
- Context and constraints

### `/tools-map/` - Capability Graph

Knowledge graph connecting:

- Tools ← → Capabilities ← → User Contexts
- Interaction methods (keyboard, voice, automation)
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- Accessibility profiles

### `/experiments/` - Active Exploration

Sandboxed attempts at new workflows:

- Hypothesis being tested
- Setup and configuration
- Results and observations
- Validation status

### `/validated-workflows/` - Proven Solutions

Successfully tested and integrated pathways:

- Complete implementation guides
- Optimization notes
- Accessibility annotations
- Maintenance requirements

## Workflow

1. **Observe**: Detect friction or express exploration goal
2. **Explore**: Agents search for alternatives and possibilities
3. **Translate**: Adapt findings to user's constraints and context
4. **Validate**: Test in experiments, gather observations
5. **Integrate**: Move validated workflows into daily practice
6. **Externalize**: Document for ensemble reflection and refinement

## Ensemble Members

- **Human**: Goals, validation, contextual wisdom, accessibility requirements
- **Code Agent**: Implementation, research, tool integration, scaffolding
- **Other agents**: (TBD based on needs - chat for strategy, investigator for patterns)

## Anti-Entropy Principle

Each interaction should increase mutual information and reduce uncertainty. The ensemble should become more capable of finding pathways over time, not less.
