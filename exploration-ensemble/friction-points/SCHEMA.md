# [Friction Description]

## Context
**What I was trying to do**: Clear goal statement

**What happened**: The barrier encountered

**What I expected**: Ideal outcome

## Current Workaround
How you currently deal with this (if at all)

## Why It's Friction
- Time cost
- Cognitive load
- Physical strain
- Blocks flow state
- Prevents exploration

## Unknown Unknowns Suspected
What you suspect might exist but don't know about:
- [ ] Better tools you haven't heard of
- [ ] Workflows you can't conceive
- [ ] Automations you don't know are possible
- [ ] Accessibility features you're unaware of

## Constraints
- Can't change: [tools, environment, physical limitations]
- Prefer to preserve: [current skills, workflows, tools you like]
- Open to: [learning new tools, changing workflows, automation]

## Exploration Status
- [ ] Agents dispatched to research
- [ ] Findings gathered
- [ ] Experiments running
- [ ] Solution validated
- [ ] Integrated into workflow
