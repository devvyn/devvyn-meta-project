```

### Resource Allocation

- **Time Budget**: Up to 50% of available cycles for high-value projects
- **Risk Level**: Low to Medium - careful, monitored deployment
- **Approval Process**: Required for production integration

### Constitutional Boundaries

✅ **Allowed**:

- Production-quality development
- Beta testing with willing participants
- Integration with existing production systems (with approval)
- Resource allocation for proven value

⚠️ **Requires Approval**:

- Production deployment
- Changes affecting multiple projects
- Resource allocation > 25% for single project
- Framework constitutional modifications

### Quality Standards

- **Code Quality**: Production-ready standards
- **Documentation**: Complete user and technical documentation
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Performance**: Meets or exceeds existing benchmarks
- **Security**: Security review completed for sensitive changes

### Cultivation Process

1. **Growth Planning**: Define implementation roadmap
2. **Incremental Development**: Build in stages with regular validation
3. **Beta Testing**: Limited deployment to willing users/projects
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track metrics and user feedback
5. **Refinement**: Iterate based on real-world usage
6. **Harvest Preparation**: Prepare for full production deployment

### Example Garden Projects

- "Peer Review System v1.0" - specification review workflow
- "Ecosystem Services Registry" - cross-project component sharing
- "Knowledge Graph Engine" - automated insight discovery
- "Federated Framework Interface" - multi-organization collaboration

### Maintenance Philosophy

**Garden projects require ongoing care:**

- Regular monitoring and health checks
- User feedback integration
- Performance optimization
- Documentation updates
- Security maintenance

### Success Metrics

- **User Adoption**: Actual usage by projects/agents
- **Performance Impact**: Measurable improvements
- **Quality Metrics**: Error rates, user satisfaction
- **Integration Success**: Smooth operation with existing systems

**Philosophy**: "Cultivate with care, harvest with confidence" - patient development for lasting impact.
