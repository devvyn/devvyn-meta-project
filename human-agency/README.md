# Human Agency Practice

**Philosophy**: Agents manage operations. Humans manage themselves. Both need integration.

## What This Is

A minimal daily practice for self-accountability with human autonomy.
Bridge-integrated so agents have context, but you maintain control.

**Not**: Productivity optimization, external management, AI-driven life coaching

**Is**: Trust-based self-tracking, integration signal, authentic check-in

## The Practice

**File**: `daily-check-in.md`

**Three Questions**:

1. **Energy Level** (1-10): How resourced do you feel today?
2. **What Needs Protecting**: Time, attention, relationships - what needs boundaries?
3. **What Wants Creating**: Technical, personal, creative - what calls to you?

**Frequency**: Each morning, or whenever state shifts significantly

**Duration**: 60 seconds

## How It Works

### Human Side

- Update `daily-check-in.md` authentically, not aspirationally
- No judgment, no scoring, just signal
- You control what you share and when
- Skip days without guilt - the practice serves you, not vice versa

### Agent Side

- Bridge scripts read check-in during agent registration
- Context displayed at session start
- Agents respect as signal, not command
- No enforcement, no optimization, just awareness

### Integration Example

```bash
$ ./scripts/bridge-register.sh register code

✅ Agent 'code' registered with session: code-devvyn-1234567890
📁 Session file: bridge/registry/sessions/code-devvyn-1234567890.json

👤 Human Context (from daily check-in):
========================================
Energy Level: 7/10
Needs Protection: Morning deep work time, evening family time
Wants Creating: TLA+ event sourcing refactor, human agency docs

```

## Zen Integration

This practice embodies:

- **Simplicity**: Three questions, one minute
- **Presence**: Check in with actual state, not desired state
- **Integration**: Personal domain informs operational planning

## Functional Purity

State flow:

```
Human reflection → daily-check-in.md → bridge-register reads → agent context
```

No side effects, no mutations of human state. Pure signal transmission.

## Getting Started

1. **Tomorrow morning**: Fill in `daily-check-in.md` honestly
2. **Start work session**: Register agent and see context display
3. **Notice**: How does seeing your own context affect planning?
4. **Iterate**: Adjust questions if they don't serve you

## Non-Goals

❌ Track everything
❌ Optimize productivity
❌ Compare days
❌ Achieve consistency
❌ Prove anything to anyone

✅ Check in authentically
✅ Signal capacity
✅ Integrate human and operational
✅ Maintain autonomy
