## Integration Notes

This file is read by the bridge system and agents for context awareness.
Update authentically, not aspirationally. No judgment, just signal.

**Purpose**: Self-accountability with human autonomy, not productivity optimization.

**Usage**:

- Update each morning (or whenever your state shifts significantly)
- Bridge scripts read this for energy/capacity signals
- Agents respect this as context, not command
- You control what you share and when
