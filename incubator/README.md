# Idea Incubator

## Raw Ideas & Early-Stage Exploration

**Purpose**: Safe space for nascent ideas before they require resources or approval

### What Belongs Here

- **Raw concepts** captured from conversations, research, inspiration
- **Rough sketches** of potential directions
- **Quick experiments** that can be done in minutes/hours
- **"What if" explorations** without commitment

### Entry Criteria

- Any idea worth preserving for future consideration
- No formal validation required
- Can be as rough as bullet points or stream-of-consciousness

### Exit Criteria (to Kitchen)

- Idea has been refined into a concrete proposal
- Basic feasibility assessed
- Resource requirements estimated
- Clear next steps identified

### Structure

```

├── raw-ideas/           # Unprocessed thoughts and concepts
├── quick-experiments/   # Small tests and proofs-of-concept
├── inspiration/         # External research, precedents, ideas from elsewhere
└── archive/            # Ideas that didn't progress but worth keeping
```

### Examples of Incubator Content

- "What if we tracked emotional sentiment in project communications?"
- "Could we use blockchain for immutable specification versioning?"
- "Biological pattern: how do mycorrhizal networks share resources?"
- "Random idea: specification-driven infrastructure as code"

### Constitutional Boundaries

✅ **Allowed**: Documentation, research, thought experiments, small local tests
❌ **Not Allowed**: Changes to production systems, resource allocation, commitments

### Workflow

1. **Capture**: Drop ideas here immediately when they occur
2. **Percolate**: Let ideas sit and develop naturally
3. **Cross-pollinate**: Look for connections between ideas
4. **Refine**: Develop promising ideas into Kitchen-ready proposals

**Philosophy**: "No idea too small, no experiment too rough" - capture everything, filter later.
