- INTER_AGENT_MEMO pattern identified and standardized based on aafc-herbarium example
- Chat ↔ code integration protocols tested and operational
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Tier 3 consolidation executed successfully
- 🚀 **READY**: AAFC workspace context switch configured

## AAFC Workspace Context Switch Protocol

### **Ready for Implementation**: Graceful transition to focused development

**Workspace Configuration Complete**:

- ✅ Created `.claude/CLAUDE.md` in AAFC project with development context
- ✅ Updated meta-project tracking with handoff status
- ✅ Established inter-workspace communication protocol
- ✅ Documented priority patterns from INTER_AGENT_MEMO analysis

### **Next Session Instructions** (when you start Claude in AAFC directory)

**Issue sync command to activate**:

1. **Context Loading**: Read .claude/CLAUDE.md + INTER_AGENT_MEMO.md
2. **Priority Identification**: Focus on high-value gist patterns:
   - CSV Magic Reader for Darwin Core field access
   - GBIF API exploration documentation
   - OCR engine evaluation templates

   - Label pattern analysis utilities
3. **Progress Reporting**: Update implementation status back to meta-project

### **Communication Channels Active**

- **Strategic consultation**: Check this key-answers.md for decisions
- **Progress updates**: Update INTER_AGENT_MEMO.md with development status
- **Blockers/resources**: Escalate to meta-project status files

**Development Focus**: Apply battle-tested patterns from historical gist analysis to v1.0 release preparation.
