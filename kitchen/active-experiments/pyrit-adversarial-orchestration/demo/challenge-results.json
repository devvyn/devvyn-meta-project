  "target_proposal": "**Proposal: Automated Pattern Extraction System**\n### Architecture\n1. **Continuous Event Stream Processing**\n   - Monitor `bridge/events/` directory for new events\n   - Parse events in real-time (no 24-hour delay)\n   - Feed to pattern detection ML model\n2. **Pattern Detection Model**\n   - Use unsupervised learning (clustering, anomaly detection)\n   - Trained on historical event log (6 months of data)\n   - Identifies: repeated sequences, anomalies, correlations\n   - Confidence scoring for each detected pattern\n3. **Auto-Pattern Documentation**\n   - Patterns with confidence >80% \u2192 auto-added to `decision-patterns.md`\n   - Patterns 60-80% \u2192 flagged for INVESTIGATOR review\n   - Patterns <60% \u2192 logged but not acted upon\n4. **Integration Points**\n   - INVESTIGATOR: Uses ML-detected patterns in daily analysis\n   - HOPPER: Routes based on ML-confirmed patterns\n   - Chat: Strategic validation of high-impact patterns\n### Implementation Plan\n**Phase 1** (Week 1): Historical data preparation\n- Export event log to training dataset\n- Label known patterns manually (supervision)\n- Split train/test sets (80/20)\n**Phase 2** (Week 2-3): Model development\n- Experiment with: K-means clustering, DBSCAN, Isolation Forest\n- Benchmark accuracy against manually-detected patterns\n- Tune confidence thresholds\n**Phase 3** (Week 4): Production integration\n- Deploy model as LaunchAgent (runs every 15 minutes)\n- Bridge integration: new agent type \"pattern-extractor\"\n- Monitoring dashboard for pattern quality\n### Resource Requirements\n- Compute: Local MacBook sufficient for prototype\n- Data: 6 months event log (~5000 events)\n- External dependencies: scikit-learn, pandas (already available)\n- Human time: 10 hours (supervision, validation)\n### Success Metrics\n- Pattern detection latency: <15 minutes (vs 24 hours currently)\n- Pattern accuracy: >85% (measured against INVESTIGATOR manual review)\n- False positive rate: <10%\n- New patterns discovered: At least 3 per month that humans missed\n### Risks\n- Model drift: Patterns may become stale over time\n- Overfitting: Model might detect spurious patterns\n- Complexity: Adds ML complexity to system\n- Debugging: ML decisions harder to explain than rules",
