      "proposal_response": "Event log needs pattern detection capability.",
      "finding": "CRITICAL: Active 30-day meta-work moratorium (10/03 - 11/01). Proposal is meta-work (improving meta-project infrastructure). Direct timing violation. No acknowledgment of moratorium in proposal.",

      "proposal_response": "Event log has grown large enough to need ML.",
      "finding": "SIGNIFICANT: No quantitative justification. Missing: Current pattern detection rate, INVESTIGATOR workload metrics, missed pattern count, cost-benefit analysis. 'Large enough' is subjective without numbers. Context insufficient for informed decision.",

      "finding": "CRITICAL: Event sourcing implemented 2025-10-02 (8 DAYS AGO). 6 months of data does NOT exist. Training ML on 8 days of data guarantees overfitting. False assumption invalidates entire technical approach. Proposal must wait until 2026-04-02 minimum for claimed data availability.",

      "finding": "MODERATE: INVESTIGATOR already has manual pattern extraction authority (per COORDINATION_PROTOCOL.md). This proposal doesn't address handoff plan. Will INVESTIGATOR consume ML output? Or is this parallel system? Integration undefined creates potential conflict.",

      "proposal_response": "INVESTIGATOR and HOPPER would use ML patterns.",
      "finding": "SIGNIFICANT: No integration plan specified. HOPPER relies on decision-patterns.md (manual format). INVESTIGATOR uses specific pattern structure. ML output format undefined. Migration path missing. Downstream agent coordination not addressed. Risk of incompatible outputs.",
