## Pattern Catalog

### Meta-Patterns (System-Level)

- **[Just-In-Time Specificity](patterns/just-in-time-specificity.md)** - Progressive context disclosure: front-load invariants, lazy-load details. *Proven 70% context reduction.*

- **[Wisdom Extraction Philosophy](patterns/wisdom-extraction-philosophy.md)** - Extract essential innovation, discard baggage. Dual of JITS (remove vs. avoid baggage).

- **[Information Parity Design](patterns/information-parity-design.md)** - Equal access to context across agents. Enables coordination without hierarchies.

### Infrastructure Patterns

- **[Publication Surfaces](patterns/publication-surfaces.md)** - Unified interface for multi-channel output (file, stdout, remote, etc.). Decouple content from destination.

- **[Collective Resource Provisioning](patterns/collective-resource-provisioning.md)** - Shared resource management across agents. Watch folders, torrent integration, shared storage.

- **[AAFC Infrastructure Contribution Asset](patterns/aafc-infrastructure-contribution-asset.md)** - Infrastructure as contribution model. Shared resources benefit collective.

- **[Streaming Event Architecture](patterns/streaming-event-architecture.md)** - Event-driven coordination. Immutable log, pattern detection, temporal queries.

### Communication Patterns

- **[Empirically Verifiable AI Self-Reference](patterns/empirically-verifiable-ai-self-reference.md)** - Agents prove identity through behavioral evidence. Observable actions, not self-assertion.

- **[Secure API Access](patterns/secure-api-access.md)** - CRITICAL: Never display credentials in output. Keychain, env vars, safe check scripts only.

### Process Patterns

- **[Work Session Accountability](patterns/work-session-accountability.md)** - Session tracking, time boxing, work log integration.

- **[Repository Cleanup Strategy](patterns/repository-cleanup-strategy.md)** - Archive old projects systematically. Reduce cognitive load from inactive repos.

- **[Scientific Provenance Pattern](patterns/scientific-provenance-pattern.md)** - Track origin and validation of scientific claims. Ensure accuracy.

## Theory

- **[Specificity-Emergence](theory/specificity-emergence.md)** - How JITS enables emergent intelligence. Minimal prescription → organic discovery.

- **[80-20 Specificity Law](theory/80-20-specificity-law.md)** - Optimize context throughput by allocating specificity by leverage.

## Usage

**Progressive Discovery:**
1. Read pattern summaries (above)
2. Open relevant pattern file for core principle + implementation
3. Refer to examples section as needed

**Contributing Patterns:**
1. Identify reusable problem-solution pair
2. Validate: 3+ occurrences OR 2+ projects
3. Document: Problem → Solution → When to use
4. Submit to INVESTIGATOR for review
