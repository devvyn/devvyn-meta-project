# Attention Research

**Overview**: Scientific understanding of attention as a finite cognitive resource, its depletion, restoration, and optimization.

## Core Principle

> "Your life is the sum of what you pay attention to" - Winifred Gallagher

Attention is not unlimited. Directed attention depletes with use, requires restoration, and suffers from residue when switching contexts. Understanding attention's constraints is fundamental to knowledge work performance.

### Theories
Scientific frameworks for understanding attention:
- [Attention Residue Theory](theories/attention-residue-leroy.md) - Sophie Leroy's research on task-switching costs
- [Attention Restoration Theory](theories/attention-restoration-theory-kaplan.md) - Kaplan & Kaplan on nature's restorative effects
- [Flow Theory](theories/flow-theory-csikszentmihalyi.md) - Optimal experience and total concentration
- [Contemporary Attention Research](theories/contemporary-attention-mark.md) - Gloria Mark's findings (2023)

### Practical Applications
Techniques for protecting and restoring attention:
- [Deep Work Protection](practical-applications/deep-work-protection.md) - Guarding attention for cognitively demanding tasks
- [Interruption Recovery](practical-applications/interruption-recovery.md) - Ready-to-Resume plans
- [Task-Switching Costs](practical-applications/task-switching-costs.md) - Understanding cognitive penalties
- [Restoration Practices](practical-applications/attention-restoration-practices.md) - Replenishing depleted attention

### Measurements
Quantifying attention and its impacts:
- [Attention Span Trends](measurements/attention-span-trends.md) - Decline from 2.5 min to 47 sec (2004-2023)
- [Cognitive Load Assessment](measurements/cognitive-load-assessment.md) - Measuring mental demand

## Key Research Findings

1. **Attention Residue**: 25 minutes to recover from interruption (Leroy, 2009)
2. **Attention Span Decline**: 2.5 minutes (2004) → 47 seconds (2023) (Mark, 2023)
3. **Nature Restores**: Directed attention replenishes in natural environments (Kaplan, 1989)
4. **Flow Requires Setup**: 8 dimensions must align for optimal experience (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990)

## Two Types of Attention

| Type | Characteristics | Resource Cost |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| **Directed Attention** | Voluntary, effortful, focused | Depletes with use |
| **Involuntary Attention** | Captured by inherently interesting stimuli | Doesn't deplete |

- [Self-Design](../self-design/README.md) - Personal attention management

## Quick Start

1. **Time-block deep work**: Protect 90-120 minute blocks for cognitively demanding tasks
2. **Eliminate context switches**: Single-task during deep work periods
3. **Create Ready-to-Resume plans**: Document where you are + next steps when interrupted
4. **Schedule restoration**: Regular exposure to nature or "soft fascination" environments
5. **Track attention span**: Notice when focus degrades, adjust session length
