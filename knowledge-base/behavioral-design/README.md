# Behavioral Design

**Overview**: Frameworks, techniques, and ethical considerations for designing environments and systems that shape human behavior.

## Core Principle

> "Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior" - James Clear

Behavioral design recognizes that human behavior is primarily shaped by environmental context rather than willpower or intention. Small changes to choice architecture, physical spaces, and contextual cues can create disproportionate behavioral impacts.

## Navigation

### Frameworks
Core behavioral design frameworks with theoretical foundations:
- [Fogg Behavior Model](frameworks/fogg-behavior-model.md) - B=MAP (Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Prompt)
- [Atomic Habits Framework](frameworks/atomic-habits-framework.md) - Environment-driven habit formation
- [Nudge Theory](frameworks/nudge-theory.md) - Choice architecture and libertarian paternalism
- [Hook Model](frameworks/hook-model.md) - Habit-forming product design

### Techniques
Actionable methods for behavior change:
- [Tiny Habits Method](techniques/tiny-habits-method.md) - Start absurdly small
- [Environment Design](techniques/environment-design.md) - Shape the space, shape the behavior
- [Choice Architecture](techniques/choice-architecture.md) - How presentation influences decisions
- [Friction Engineering](techniques/friction-engineering.md) - Add/remove steps strategically
- [Context Prompts](techniques/context-prompts.md) - Environmental triggers

### Ethics
Moral considerations in behavioral design:
- [Hostile Architecture](ethics/hostile-architecture.md) - When design excludes
- [Libertarian Paternalism](ethics/libertarian-paternalism.md) - Guiding while preserving autonomy
- [Design Values](ethics/design-values.md) - How design encodes power and values

## Key Insights

1. **Environment > Willpower**: Design contexts that make desired behaviors default
2. **Small Changes, Big Impact**: Tiny environmental modifications compound
3. **Context is King**: Cues and triggers drive behavior more than intentions
4. **Ethics Matter**: Behavioral design encodes values and affects human dignity

## Quick Start

1. **Audit your environment**: What behaviors does your current space encourage?
2. **Choose ONE behavior** to change (start small)
3. **Apply B=MAP**: Increase Motivation OR Ability, add effective Prompt
4. **Remove friction** for desired behaviors, add friction for undesired ones
5. **Iterate**: Measure, adjust, refine
