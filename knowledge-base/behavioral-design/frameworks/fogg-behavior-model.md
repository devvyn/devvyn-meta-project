## 📚 Core Concept

> **Behavior happens when 3 elements converge simultaneously**

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  B = M × A × P                          │
│                                         │
│  ✓ Motivation (want to do it)          │
│  ✓ Ability (can do it)                 │
│  ✓ Prompt (reminder/trigger)           │
│                                         │
│  Missing ANY element = No behavior     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

For any behavior to occur, a person must have all three elements at the same moment. High motivation alone won't trigger behavior without a prompt. An effective prompt won't work if ability is low.

---

## 🎯 Key Principles

### 💡 Principle 1: All Three Must Converge Simultaneously

**The Rule:** Behavior requires all three elements at the same moment.

```
Time ──────────────────────>
         ┌──┐
    M    │██│ High motivation
    A    │██│ High ability
    P    │██│ Good prompt    } = Behavior occurs ✓
         └──┘

         ┌──┐
    M    │  │ Low motivation
    A    │██│ High ability
    P    │██│ Good prompt    } = No behavior ✗
         └──┘
```

**Implication:** Can't compensate for missing element by maximizing others.

### 💡 Principle 2: Only Two Elements Are Adjustable

✅ **CAN control:**
- **Ability** (make behavior easier)
- **Prompt** (add/remove triggers)

❌ **CANNOT reliably control:**
- **Motivation** (too variable, fluctuates)

┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🎯 DESIGN IMPLICATION                         │
│ Focus on making behaviors easy (↑A)           │
│ and well-prompted (↑P), not motivating (M)    │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────┘

### 💡 Principle 3: Ability Trumps Motivation

**Fogg's Simplicity Principle:** The easier a behavior is, the more likely it will occur.

┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🎯 CORE INSIGHT                               │
│ Making behavior easier (↑ Ability) beats      │
│ trying to increase motivation                 │
│                                               │
│ People with "better willpower" often just     │
│ have easier paths to desired behaviors        │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────┘

**Action:** Always ask "How can I make this easier?" before "How can I get more motivated?"

### 💡 Principle 4: Three Types of Prompts

| Type | Examples | Reliability | When to Use |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 👤 **Person** | Notifications, alarms, reminders | Low (easy to ignore) | Short-term only |
| 🏠 **Context** | Object placement, visual triggers | Medium | Sustainable habits |
| 🔗 **Action** | Existing habits as anchors | High (most reliable) | Long-term automation |

⚠️ **Best practice:** Use context prompts sparingly; too many decrease effectiveness (prompt fatigue).

## 🛠️ Actionable Techniques

### ⭐ Technique 1: Tiny Habits Method

**What:** Start with extremely small behaviors taking <30 seconds

**Recipe Format:**
```
After I [ANCHOR MOMENT],
I will [TINY BEHAVIOR],
Then I will [CELEBRATION]
```

**How to Apply:**

| Step | Action | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1️⃣ | Identify desired behavior | Want to exercise daily |
| 2️⃣ | Make it tiny | 2 push-ups (not 30) |
| 3️⃣ | Find anchor moment | After I pour coffee |
| 4️⃣ | Celebrate immediately | "Nice!" + smile |
| 5️⃣ | Let it grow naturally | Will expand to 5, 10, 20... |

**When to Use:** Building any new habit or changing established patterns

**Evidence:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Small behaviors have higher success rates (ability threshold always met)

**Examples:**
```
After I pour coffee → meditate 60sec → "Awesome!"
After I sit for dinner → say 1 gratitude → smile
After I close laptop → 10 push-ups → "Victory!"
After I brush teeth → floss 1 tooth → celebrate
```

**Why it works:** Once established, tiny habits naturally expand. People who start with "1 push-up" often end up doing 20+ because they showed up and momentum carried them.

---

### ⭐ Technique 2: Context Prompt Design

**What:** Use environmental cues to trigger desired behaviors automatically

**How to Apply:**

1. **Place visual reminders** where behavior should occur
2. **Position objects** to enable behavior (e.g., running shoes by bed)
3. **Modify environment** to make cues obvious
4. **Remove prompts** for undesired behaviors

**When to Use:** Making behaviors automatic (don't rely on memory or willpower)

**Evidence:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ Context prompts work because they don't require remembering

**Examples:**

| Desired Behavior | Context Prompt |
|------------------|----------------|
| Take medication | Pill bottle on breakfast table |
| Practice guitar | Guitar on stand (not in case) |
| Drink more water | Water bottle on desk |
| Use standing desk | Raise desk before leaving each day |
| Check messages | Terminal alias shows inbox count |

⚠️ **Warning:** Too many context prompts = visual clutter = effectiveness decreases. Use 1-3 max per space.

---

### ⭐ Technique 3: Ability Boosting

**What:** Make target behavior easier by reducing steps, time, or effort

**The 5 Ability Factors to Optimize:**

| Factor | Question | Optimization Example |
|--------|----------|----------------------|
| ⏱️ **Time** | Does it take long? | Meal prep Sunday → eating healthy easier all week |
| 💰 **Money** | Is it expensive? | Use free resources first |
| 🧠 **Mental** | Is it hard to think through? | Templates reduce cognitive load |
| 💪 **Physical** | Is it physically demanding? | Start with easiest version |
| 🔄 **Routine** | Does it break my routine? | Stack onto existing habit |

**How to Apply:**

1. Identify friction points in current behavior
2. Remove obstacles systematically
3. Simplify the process
4. Use tools/technology to reduce effort
5. Start with easiest possible version

**When to Use:** Motivation exists but behavior isn't happening (ability is the bottleneck)

**Evidence:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ People with seemingly better "willpower" often just have easier paths

**Examples:**
- Pre-packed gym bag → workout barrier reduced
- Password manager → security behaviors easier
- Templates for common tasks → less decision fatigue
- Standing desk preset buttons → posture change effortless

---

### ⭐ Technique 4: Prompt Matching

**What:** Match prompt type to behavior sustainability goal

**Decision Matrix:**

| Goal Duration | Best Prompt Type | Rationale |
|---------------|------------------|-----------|
| **One-time** | Person (notification) | Just need reminder once |
| **Short-term** (weeks) | Context (visual) | Needs to be seen regularly |
| **Long-term** (months+) | Action (habit stack) | Most reliable, least intrusive |

**How to Apply:**

1. **Short-term reminders:** Use person prompts (notifications, alarms)
2. **Long-term habits:** Use action prompts (anchor to existing routine)
3. **Environmental defaults:** Use context prompts (visual placement)

**When to Use:** Different goals require different prompt strategies

**Evidence:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ Sustainable habits need reliable, automatic prompts (action > context > person)

**Example Progression:**
```
Week 1:    Alarm at 9am (person prompt) → take vitamin
Week 2-4:  Vitamin bottle on counter (context prompt)
Month 2+:  After breakfast → take vitamin (action prompt) ✓ SUSTAINABLE
```

## 📊 Fogg Behavior Grid

Fogg identified **15 behavior types** based on duration and frequency:

| Type | Duration | Examples |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Dot** | One-time | Vote, buy product, donate once |
| **Span** | Fixed duration | Run for 20 min, study for 2 hours |
| **Path** | Ongoing | Daily meditation, weekly review |

**Design Implication:** Different types require different approaches. Dot behaviors need high motivation at single moment. Path behaviors need sustainable systems.

## 💡 Implementation Notes

### Difficulty & Timeline

| Aspect | Rating/Duration |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Difficulty** | ⭐⭐☆☆☆ Easy (accessible framework, clear application) |
| **Time to Results** | Days-weeks for tiny habits; months for complex behavior change |
| **Success Rate** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ High (when following tiny principle) |
| **Learning Curve** | ⭐☆☆☆☆ Minimal (simple model, intuitive) |

### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| ❌ Starting too big | Ability threshold too high | ✅ Make it 2-min or less |
| ❌ Relying on motivation alone | M is variable, unreliable | ✅ Increase ability or add better prompt |
| ❌ Too many prompts | Prompt fatigue, tune out | ✅ Use 1-2 context prompts max |
| ❌ Not celebrating | Positive emotion wires habit | ✅ Immediate "Nice!" or physical gesture |
| ❌ Multiple habits at once | Cognitive overload | ✅ Master one, then add next |
| ❌ Skipping anchor | Prompt not reliable | ✅ Always attach to existing routine |

### ✅ Success Metrics

| Metric | How to Measure | Target |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| **Consistency** | Days in a row | 7+ day streak |
| **Automaticity** | Happens without thinking | "Just do it automatically" |
| **Natural growth** | Tiny behavior expands | Started with 1, now doing 10+ |
| **Positive affect** | Enjoy the behavior | Look forward to it |
| **Identity shift** | Self-concept changes | "I am a [person who does X]" |

## 🏠 Local Meta-Project Applications

### Human Agency Practice

**B=MAP Analysis:**
```
Component              B=MAP Element
────────────────────────────────────
Morning time anchor → Prompt (action prompt - reliable)
60 seconds duration → Ability (very easy)
Self-knowledge goal → Motivation (intrinsic)
```

**Why it works:** All three elements present, ability kept minimal, prompt is existing routine.

### Work Session Accountability

**B=MAP Analysis:**
```
Component                B=MAP Element
──────────────────────────────────────
Session start         → Prompt (context - opening terminal)
Template structure    → Ability (reduced friction)
Professional duty     → Motivation (AAFC accountability)
```

**Enhancement opportunity:** Make even easier (↑A) by auto-populating template.

### Bridge Message Checking

**Current:**
```
Manual check → Prompt (must remember) → Often forgotten
```

**B=MAP Optimization:**
```
After terminal opens (anchor) → Ability (1 command)
I will check bridge → Prompt (action - reliable)
See coordination status → Motivation (better workflow)
```

**Implementation:**
```bash
# In shell startup, add visual prompt:
bridge-inbox-count  # Shows: "📬 2 messages waiting"
```

### Behavior Design Opportunities

**1. Code Review Habit:**
```
After I commit code (anchor/prompt)
I will read 1 line of my changes (tiny/ability)
Then I celebrate "Caught issues early!" (reinforce)

Motivation: Higher code quality
```

**2. Knowledge Base Updates:**
```
After I research a topic (anchor/prompt)
I will write 1 sentence summary (tiny/ability)
Then I celebrate "Building collective memory!" (reinforce)

Motivation: Help future self & team
```

**3. Bridge Registration:**
```
After I open terminal for coding (anchor/prompt)
I will run bridge-register (tiny/ability)
Then I see inbox count (feedback/reinforce)

Motivation: Stay coordinated
```
