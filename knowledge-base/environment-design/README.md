# Environment Design

**Overview**: How physical, digital, and architectural environments shape human behavior, cognition, and wellbeing.

## Core Principle

> "We shape our buildings; thereafter they shape us" - Winston Churchill

Environments encode values, influence behavior, and affect cognitive performance. Good design emerges from understanding recurring patterns in how humans interact with space, not imposing arbitrary aesthetic preferences.

### Architectural Patterns
Foundational design thinking:
- [Pattern Language](architectural-patterns/pattern-language-alexander.md) - Christopher Alexander's 253 patterns
- [Timeless Way of Building](architectural-patterns/timeless-way-building.md) - "Quality without a name"
- [99% Invisible Design Lessons](architectural-patterns/99pi-design-lessons.md) - Design we don't notice
- [DeafSpace Universal Design](architectural-patterns/deafspace-universal-design.md) - Specific constraints → universal improvement

### Workspace Design
Optimizing environments for cognitive performance:
- [Cognitive Performance Factors](workspace-design/cognitive-performance-factors.md) - Environmental impact (up to 20%)
- [Biophilic Design](workspace-design/biophilic-design.md) - Nature elements (15% wellbeing, 6% productivity, 15% creativity)
- [Lighting & Acoustics](workspace-design/lighting-acoustics.md) - Sensory environment optimization
- [Spatial Organization](workspace-design/spatial-organization.md) - Zoning for different work modes
- [Ergonomics](workspace-design/ergonomics.md) - Physical interface optimization

### Digital Environments
Interface and interaction design:
- [Notification Design](digital-environments/notification-design.md) - Managing interruption
- [Interface Friction](digital-environments/interface-friction.md) - Strategic resistance
- [Digital Minimalism](digital-environments/digital-minimalism.md) - Intentional technology

## Key Insights

1. **Physical environment affects performance by up to 20%**
2. **Biophilic design** (plants, nature views) significantly improves wellbeing and productivity
3. **Pattern recognition** reveals universal solutions to recurring design problems
4. **Design encodes values**: Architecture embeds power structures into physical space
5. **Universal design** often emerges from designing for specific constraints

## Christopher Alexander's Pattern Approach

1. **Recognize forces** in environments (privacy needs, social spaces, movement patterns)
2. **Identify patterns** of behavior and space that resolve these forces
3. **Combine patterns** adaptively for specific circumstances
4. **Iterate** based on lived experience

- [Self-Design](../self-design/README.md) - Personal environment crafting
- [Publication Surfaces Pattern](../patterns/publication-surfaces.md) - Digital environment design

## Quick Start

1. **Audit workspace**: Light quality, noise levels, visual clutter, ergonomics
2. **Add nature**: Plants, natural light, views of nature
3. **Zone spaces**: Dedicated areas for focus, collaboration, restoration
4. **Reduce friction**: Place frequently-used items within easy reach
5. **Iterate weekly**: Small adjustments compound
