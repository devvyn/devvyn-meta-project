# Integration

**Purpose**: Synthesize frameworks, guide technique selection, and map connections between behavioral design, attention research, and environment design.

## Quick Navigation

### Core Documents
- [Cross-Framework Comparison](cross-framework-comparison.md) - How frameworks relate, overlap, and complement each other
- [Technique Selection Guide](technique-selection-guide.md) - Decision trees and quick reference for choosing right technique

## Integration Principles

### 1. Frameworks Complement, Not Compete

Each framework addresses different aspects of behavior change and environment design:
- **Fogg**: Micro-level behavior triggers
- **Clear**: Systems and environment design
- **Nudge**: Choice architecture for decisions
- **Leroy**: Costs of context switching
- **Csikszentmihalyi**: Conditions for optimal experience
- **Alexander**: Pattern-based space design

**Use multiple frameworks together** for comprehensive solutions.

### 2. Start Specific, Expand Systematically

**Recommended progression**:
1. Choose ONE behavior/problem to address
2. Select primary framework (use Technique Selection Guide)
3. Apply supporting frameworks as needed
4. Iterate and refine
5. Document as pattern for reuse

### 3. Context Determines Technique

No single "best" approach. Selection depends on:
- **Current state**: Starting vs. maintaining behavior
- **Time horizon**: Immediate vs. long-term change
- **Scale**: Individual vs. team vs. organization
- **Work type**: Deep focus vs. collaboration vs. creative
- **Resources**: Time, autonomy, environmental control

### 4. Integration Compounds Value

**Single framework impact**: Linear improvement
**Multiple frameworks combined**: Exponential improvement

**Example**:
- Fogg alone: Start behavior
- + Clear: Make sustainable
- + Nudge: Remove friction
- + Flow: Optimize performance
- + Alexander: Design space that supports all of above

**Result**: Behavior becomes natural, automatic, and intrinsically rewarding.

## Common Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Behavior Initiation → Sustainability

**Goal**: Start new behavior and make it stick

**Framework sequence**:
1. **Fogg (Tiny Habits)**: Make it absurdly small to start
2. **Nudge (Defaults)**: Set environment to favor behavior
3. **Clear (Environment)**: Design space that supports habit
4. **Clear (Identity)**: Shift self-concept to sustain

**Example**: Building documentation habit
```
Week 1: Fogg - "After code commit, write 1 sentence" (tiny)
Week 2-4: Nudge - Template auto-opens after commit (default)
Month 2: Clear - Docs folder in bookmarks, visible (environment)
Month 3+: Clear - "I am a knowledge builder" (identity)
```

### Pattern 2: Performance Optimization

**Goal**: Improve quality and depth of existing work

**Framework combination**:
1. **Attention Residue**: Minimize context switches
2. **Flow**: Create optimal work conditions
3. **Clear**: Environment that eliminates distractions
4. **Nudge**: Default schedule that protects time

**Example**: Deep coding sessions
```
Structure (Leroy): 90-min blocks, 10-min buffers, Ready-to-Resume notes
Conditions (Flow): Clear goal, tests for feedback, challenge matched to skill
Environment (Clear): Full-screen editor, phone elsewhere, single task
Defaults (Nudge): Calendar shows "Deep Work 9-10:30am" daily
```

### Pattern 3: Space Design for Behavior

**Goal**: Create environment that naturally produces desired behaviors

**Framework combination**:
1. **Alexander (Pattern Language)**: Identify forces, apply patterns
2. **Clear (Environment Design)**: Choice architecture for habits
3. **Nudge (Physical Arrangement)**: Placement influences decisions
4. **Flow**: Support optimal experience

**Example**: Home office design
```
Forces (Alexander): Need focus vs. collaboration; privacy vs. connection
Patterns (Alexander): Workspace Enclosure, Light on Two Sides, Window Place
Environment (Clear): Current project tools at eye level, distractions hidden
Nudge: Standing desk default, healthy snacks visible, junk food in kitchen
Flow: Clear desk for focused mind, ergonomic setup, adjustable lighting
```

## Using This Section

### When Starting New Project

1. Read [Technique Selection Guide](technique-selection-guide.md)
2. Find your symptom/problem in decision trees
3. Follow framework recommendation
4. Check [Cross-Framework Comparison](cross-framework-comparison.md) for complementary techniques
5. Combine 2-3 frameworks for comprehensive solution

### When Troubleshooting

1. Use "Emergency Troubleshooting" section in [Technique Selection Guide](technique-selection-guide.md)
2. Check if all framework elements are present (e.g., Fogg's M-A-P)
3. Review environment for hidden obstacles
4. Consider if identity aligns with behavior

### When Designing Systems

1. Start with [Cross-Framework Comparison](cross-framework-comparison.md) - Meta-Framework section
2. Follow 5-phase integrated approach:
   - Assess (Pattern Language)
   - Design (All frameworks)
   - Implement (Fogg + Clear)
   - Optimize (Flow + Leroy)
   - Evolve (Alexander + Clear)

### When Building on Existing Patterns

1. Review meta-project patterns through framework lens
2. Identify which frameworks are already implicitly used
3. Make implicit explicit (document framework connections)
4. Add missing framework elements
5. Enhance with cross-framework synthesis

## Meta-Project Specific

### Current Integrations

The meta-project already uses integrated approaches:

**Work Session Accountability**:
- Fogg: Session start as anchor
- Clear: System (not goal)
- Leroy: Ready-to-Resume pattern
- Nudge: Template as default

**Human Agency Practice**:
- Fogg: Time-based prompt, 60-second habit
- Clear: Identity-based (human autonomy)
- Alexander: Forces recognized (coordination vs. agency)

**Bridge System**:
- Nudge: Easy defaults for registration
- Clear: Environment for coordination
- Alexander: Communication pattern

### Enhancement Opportunities

**Make frameworks explicit**:
- Tag each pattern with frameworks used
- Document forces (Alexander) systematically
- Map behaviors to B=MAP (Fogg)
- Identify identity assumptions (Clear)

**Fill gaps**:
- Add Flow support (session structure)
- Enhance environment design (workspace patterns)
- Create nudges for coordination

**Systematic integration**:
- Use Meta-Framework approach for new patterns
- Document technique combinations that work
- Build pattern language of proven integrations
