## Decision Trees

### Tree 1: Habit Formation

```
Want to build new habit?
│
├─ Never done this before?
│  └─ Use: Tiny Habits (make it absurdly small)
│     Example: 1 push-up, not 30
│
├─ Tried before but stopped?
│  │
│  ├─ Too hard / took too long?
│  │  └─ Use: Two-Minute Rule
│  │     Example: "Read 1 page" not "read 30min"
│  │
│  ├─ Forgot to do it?
│  │  └─ Use: Habit Stacking or Context Prompts
│  │     Example: After coffee, do X
│  │
│  └─ Lost motivation?
│     └─ Use: Identity-Based Habits
│        Example: "I am a runner" not "I want to run"
│
└─ It's started but not automatic?
   └─ Use: Environment Design + Friction Engineering
      Example: Make good habit obvious/easy; bad habit hidden/hard
```

### Tree 2: Focus and Attention

```
Having trouble focusing?
│
├─ Get interrupted frequently?
│  │
│  ├─ External interruptions?
│  │  └─ Use: Environment Design + Time-Blocking
│  │     - Remove notification sources
│  │     - Communicate boundaries
│  │     - Schedule uninterrupted blocks
│  │
│  └─ Self-interrupting?
│     └─ Use: Friction Engineering + Pre-Commitment
│        - Put phone in different room
│        - Block distracting websites
│        - Use focus tools
│
├─ Can't recover from interruptions?
│  └─ Use: Ready-to-Resume Plan
│     - Document state before switching
│     - Plan next action
│     - 30-60 seconds to close loop
│
├─ Focus feels shallow?
│  └─ Use: Flow Environment Design
│     - 90-120 minute blocks
│     - Clear goals
│     - Immediate feedback
│     - Remove distractions
│
└─ Task feels wrong (boredom/anxiety)?
   └─ Use: Challenge-Skill Calibration
      - Bored: Increase challenge
      - Anxious: Reduce challenge or build skills
```

### Tree 3: Environment and Space

```
Space doesn't support your work?
│
├─ Don't know what's wrong?
│  └─ Use: Force Recognition (Pattern Language)
│     - Observe how space is actually used
│     - Note conflicts (e.g., need focus vs. interruptions)
│     - Identify which forces are unresolved
│
├─ Know the problem, not the solution?
│  └─ Use: Pattern Language Library
│     - Find pattern addressing your forces
│     - Light on Two Sides (natural light)
│     - Workspace Enclosure (focus)
│     - Intimacy Gradient (public → private flow)
│
├─ Solution is clear, need implementation?
│  └─ Use: Incremental Repair
│     - Apply one pattern at a time
│     - Start small
│     - Observe impact
│     - Iterate
│
└─ Need to influence behavior through space?
   └─ Use: Choice Architecture + Environment Design
      - Eye-level: desired behaviors
      - Hidden: undesired behaviors
      - Defaults: best options
      - Friction: add for bad, remove for good
```

## Technique Combinations

### For Building Sustainable Habits

**Combine**:
1. Fogg's Tiny Habits (start)
2. Clear's Environment Design (support)
3. Clear's Identity-Based Habits (sustain)
4. Nudge's Defaults (easy path)

**Example**: Exercise habit
```
Tiny: Put on gym shoes (don't go to gym, just shoes)
Environment: Shoes visible by bed
Identity: "I am an athlete"
Default: Morning = athletic wear
```

### For Protecting Deep Work

**Combine**:
1. Attention Residue: Minimize switches
2. Flow: Create optimal conditions
3. Atomic Habits: Environment that supports focus
4. Nudge: Default schedule blocks

**Example**: Writing session
```
Residue: 90-min block, no email checks
Flow: Clear word count goal, distraction-free editor
Environment: Full-screen mode, phone in other room
Default: Calendar shows "Deep Work" 9-10:30am daily
```

### For Workspace Optimization

**Combine**:
1. Pattern Language: Identify forces
2. Atomic Habits: Choice architecture
3. Flow: Performance conditions
4. Nudge: Smart defaults

**Example**: Home office
```
Pattern: Light on Two Sides + Workspace Enclosure
Atomic: Eye-level = current project tools
Flow: Clear desk for clear mind, single monitor for focus
Nudge: Standing desk is default position
```

## Emergency Troubleshooting

### "Nothing is working"

**Diagnosis**:
1. Check all three Fogg elements (M, A, P)
   - Is motivation present? (If not, wrong behavior)
   - Is ability high? (If not, make easier)
   - Is prompt effective? (If not, add better trigger)

2. Check environment
   - Is desired behavior easy?
   - Is undesired behavior hard?
   - Are there hidden obstacles?

3. Check identity alignment
   - Does this behavior match self-concept?
   - If not, reframe identity first

**Fix**: Start with absolute smallest version that aligns with identity

### "It worked then stopped"

**Common causes**:
1. **Habit fatigue**: Too many habits at once
   - Fix: Pause all but one, master it, then add next

2. **Challenge mismatch**: Grew skills, task too easy
   - Fix: Increase challenge (Flow calibration)

3. **Identity conflict**: Behavior doesn't fit self-concept
   - Fix: Reframe as identity-based

4. **Environmental change**: Context shifted
   - Fix: Redesign for new environment

### "It's taking too long"

**Reality check**: Behavior change timelines
- Automatic habit: 18-254 days (average 66)
- Identity shift: Months to years
- Flow mastery: Years of practice
- Environmental quality: Ongoing evolution

**Impatience fixes**:
1. Focus on systems, not goals
2. Make progress visible (tracking)
3. Celebrate small wins (Fogg's principle)
4. Compound thinking (1% daily = 37× yearly)
