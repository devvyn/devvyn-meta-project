## Overview

Talk of the Town is a **social simulation framework** that generates an American small town and simulates its complete history over 200 years (typically 1839-1979), with emphasis on:
- Social exchanges between characters
- Internal lives and beliefs
- Character knowledge phenomena
- Emergent narrative events

## Core Architecture

### 1. Temporal Simulation Engine

**Scale**: Day-by-day simulation over 200+ years

**What Gets Simulated**:
- Character births, deaths, marriages
- Job changes, relocations
- Social relationships (friendships, rivalries, romances)
- Knowledge propagation (gossip, rumors, secrets)
- Economic activity
- Town geography and buildings

**Approach**: Event-driven simulation with character agency

### 2. Character Knowledge System

**Most sophisticated aspect of Talk of the Town.**

The system simulates:
- **What characters know** (facts, beliefs, rumors)
- **How they learned it** (direct experience, gossip, inference)
- **Who they heard it from** (provenance tracking)
- **When they learned it** (temporal knowledge)
- **What they believe vs. what's true** (epistemic modeling)

**Example**: Character A might believe Character B committed a crime (based on gossip from Character C), even though it's false. This creates narrative potential.

### 3. Social Network Modeling

**Relationship Types**:
- Family (parent, child, sibling, spouse)
- Professional (employer, employee, colleague)
- Social (friend, acquaintance, enemy)
- Romantic (crush, dating, married, divorced)

**Relationship Dynamics**:
- Relationships form, strengthen, weaken, dissolve over time
- Based on proximity, shared activities, personality compatibility
- Influenced by third-party relationships (friend-of-friend effects)

### 4. Dialogue Generation System

**Paper**: "Characters Who Speak Their Minds: Dialogue Generation in Talk of the Town" (AIIDE)

**Method**:
- Template-based generation
- Informed by character knowledge state
- Reflects character personality and emotional state
- Can gossip, lie, confess, reminisce
- References specific events from simulation history

**Innovation**: Dialogue isn't generic - it's grounded in shared history and character beliefs.

### 5. Narrative Extraction

**The Challenge**: 200 years of simulation = millions of events. How to find the story?

**Approaches Used**:

1. **Query-Based Extraction**: Ask specific questions
   - "Who had the most tumultuous marriage?"
   - "What was the town's biggest scandal?"
   - "Which family had the longest feud?"

2. **Event Salience Scoring**: Algorithmically rate events by narrative potential
   - Unexpectedness
   - Impact on multiple characters
   - Dramatic tension
   - Reversal of fortune

3. **Character-Centered Narratives**: Follow specific NPCs through their life
   - Birth → childhood → romance → career → death
   - Focus on pivotal moments

## Related Project: Bad News

**Format**: Immersive theater experience

**Setup**:
- One untrained participant
- Two trained performers (actor + wizard)
- Town generated by Talk of the Town

**Task**:
- Participant must locate the next of kin of a recently deceased character
- Navigate the social network using dialogue with NPCs
- Deliver the bad news

**Why It Matters**: Proves that simulated history can support live improvisation when the social model is rich enough.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Simulation Scale Trade-offs

**Granularity**: Daily timesteps (not hourly or minute-by-minute)
- **Advantage**: 200 years becomes computationally feasible
- **Limitation**: Can't model events shorter than a day

**Population Size**: Typically 100-500 characters over 200 years
- **Advantage**: Rich enough for complex social networks
- **Limitation**: Can't model metropolis-scale cities

### Knowledge Representation

**Format**: Semantic network + temporal annotations

Example data structure:
```
Character A knows:
  {
    fact: "Character B owns the bakery",
    source: "witnessed (1952-03-15)",
    certainty: 0.95
  }
  {
    fact: "Character C had affair with Character D",
    source: "gossip from Character E (1960-07-22)",
    certainty: 0.6
  }
```

### Causality Tracking

**Critical for narrative coherence.**

When Event Y happens, the system records:
- What prior events made it possible (prerequisites)
- Which character actions caused it (agency)
- What random factors contributed (luck)

This enables "replay with explanation" - the system can answer "why did this happen?"

## Lessons for Simulacrum Story Generation

### What Works Well

1. **Temporal depth creates richness**: 200 years >> 200 hours
2. **Social network is the story engine**: Character relationships drive narrative
3. **Knowledge asymmetry creates drama**: What A knows that B doesn't
4. **Causality tracking enables coherence**: Can explain why events happened

### What's Challenging

1. **Computational cost**: 200 years * daily timesteps = 73,000 simulation steps
2. **Content authoring**: Need templates for dialogue, events, reactions
3. **Narrative extraction**: Finding the 1% of events that matter
4. **Player knowledge management**: How much context to give readers/listeners?

### Adaptation for Audio Dramatic Reading

**Strengths for Audio**:
- Rich character histories → character voice design
- Dialogue already generated → direct TTS input
- Temporal structure → natural chapter breaks
- Gossip/rumor mechanics → narrative tension

**Pipeline Sketch**:
```
1. Run Talk of the Town simulation (or similar)
2. Extract high-salience narrative arc (birth → crisis → resolution)
3. Generate character dialogue using knowledge system
4. Map characters to distinct TTS voices
5. Add narrator voice for scene-setting
6. Generate audio with multi-voice system
```

## Comparison to Other Approaches

| System | Time Span | Granularity | Focus |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Talk of the Town** | 200 years | Daily | Social simulation |
| **Dwarf Fortress** | Centuries | Variable | Civilization/geography |
| **The Sims** | Weeks | Real-time | Individual agency |
| **Lume** | Story-length | Scene | Reactive narrative |

Talk of the Town is unique in its emphasis on **knowledge and belief modeling** over physical simulation.

## Integration with Your Audio Lab

### Character Voice Mapping

Instead of:
- NARRATOR / HEADER / CODE / QUOTE

Use:
- NARRATOR (scene-setting, timestamps: "Summer, 1952...")
- CHARACTER_A (town sheriff, male, authoritative) → Jamie
- CHARACTER_B (schoolteacher, female, gentle) → Serena
- CHARACTER_C (barkeep, male, gruff) → Lee
- CHARACTER_D (gossip, female, animated) → Tara

### Story Structure Example

```markdown
<VOICE:NARRATOR>Summer, 1952. The town of Sheldon County, population 347.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_A>Sheriff Thompson here. Been sheriff for twenty years, and I've never seen anything like this.</VOICE:CHARACTER_A>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_B>What happened at the bakery wasn't an accident, Sheriff. I was there. I saw everything.</VOICE:CHARACTER_B>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Sarah Mitchell, the schoolteacher, had witnessed something that would tear the town apart.</VOICE:NARRATOR>
```

### Technical Requirements

**For Talk of the Town-style system**:
1. Simulation engine (Python, ~5K-10K LOC minimum)
2. Knowledge representation database
3. Event extraction algorithms
4. Narrative templating system

**For Quick Prototype**:
1. Use LLM (Claude/GPT) to generate town + characters
2. Generate key events manually or with prompting
3. Create dialogue with character consistency
4. Map to existing multi-voice TTS system ✅ (you have this!)

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Option A: Full Simulation**
   - Implement simplified Talk of the Town clone
   - Focus on 10-20 characters, 10-year span
   - Social network + knowledge graph

2. **Option B: LLM-Assisted Hybrid**
   - Use LLM to generate character backgrounds
   - Hand-craft key events or generate with prompts
   - LLM generates dialogue with character voice consistency
   - Your TTS system handles audio production ✅

3. **Option C: Narrative-First**
   - Write short story scripts directly
   - Add character voice tags manually
   - Test audio production pipeline first
   - Add procedural generation later

**Recommendation for testing**: Start with Option C, prove the audio works, then move to Option B for scalability.
