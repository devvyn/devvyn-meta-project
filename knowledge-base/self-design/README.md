# Self-Design

**Overview**: Intentional design of personal behaviors, habits, tracking systems, and patterns for sustainable performance and wellbeing.

## Core Principle

> "Be the designer of your world, and not merely the consumer of it" - James Clear

Self-design is the practice of consciously shaping your behaviors, environments, and systems rather than defaulting to external designs. It combines self-tracking, habit formation, and personal pattern recognition.

## Navigation

### Self-Tracking
Measurement and awareness:
- [Quantified Self Overview](self-tracking/quantified-self-overview.md) - Self-knowledge through numbers
- [Tracking Best Practices](self-tracking/tracking-best-practices.md) - What to track and how
- [Data Interpretation](self-tracking/data-interpretation.md) - Turning data into insights
- [Pitfalls to Avoid](self-tracking/pitfalls-to-avoid.md) - Common mistakes

### Habit Formation
Building sustainable behaviors:
- [Habit Stacking](habit-formation/habit-stacking.md) - Anchor new habits to existing routines
- [Identity-Based Habits](habit-formation/identity-based-habits.md) - "I am" vs "I want"
- [Two-Minute Rule](habit-formation/two-minute-rule.md) - Start absurdly small
- [Celebration Technique](habit-formation/celebration-technique.md) - BJ Fogg's immediate reinforcement

### Personal Patterns
Individual rhythms and tendencies:
- [Energy Management](personal-patterns/energy-management.md) - Working with natural cycles
- [Attention Patterns](personal-patterns/attention-patterns.md) - Individual focus rhythms
- [Flow Triggers](personal-patterns/flow-triggers.md) - Personal conditions for peak performance
- [Restoration Rituals](personal-patterns/restoration-rituals.md) - Replenishment practices

## Key Insights

1. **Track context, not just outcomes**: Triggers and environmental factors matter more than raw metrics
2. **Start absurdly small**: 2-minute rule beats ambitious goals
3. **Design for identity, not goals**: "I am a writer" > "I want to write a book"
4. **Data alone doesn't change behavior**: Meaningful interaction with data drives change
5. **Honor individual patterns**: Optimize for your rhythms, not idealized schedules

## Five Use Cases for Self-Tracking

1. Supporting health behavior change
2. Improved self-understanding
3. Identification of trends and relations
4. Data-driven decision-making
5. Data collection for future use

## Existing Meta-Project Patterns

This knowledge base connects to existing self-design practices:
- **Human Agency Practice**: Daily check-in (energy, boundaries, desires)
- **Work Session Accountability**: Structured time tracking
- **Bridge Integration**: Agent awareness of human context

## Quick Start

1. **Choose ONE behavior** to track (energy, focus, specific habit)
2. **Track for 7 days** including context/triggers
3. **Review for patterns** on day 8
4. **Design one intervention** based on insights
5. **Measure impact** for another 7 days
6. **Iterate**: Refine or expand
