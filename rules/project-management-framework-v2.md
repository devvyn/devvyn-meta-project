# Multi-Agent Collaboration Meta-Project Framework v2.1

## Purpose

This document establishes governance for managing multiple projects using multi-agent collaboration workflows (human + AI agents) with inclusive design that serves shared benefit while maintaining professional boundaries and scalable organization.

## Project Classification System

### Tier 1: Production Projects

- **Criteria**: Revenue-generating or employment-critical
- **Context**: Dedicated git repositories with full CI/CD
- **Agent Authority**: Technical implementation, code optimization, pattern application
- **Human Authority**: Strategic priorities, quality standards, stakeholder communication
- **Review Cycle**: Exception-based monitoring with automated KPI alerts

### Tier 2: Development Projects

- **Criteria**: High potential, active development, clear roadmap
- **Context**: Git repos with basic automation
- **Agent Authority**: Rapid prototyping, technical architecture, code generation
- **Human Authority**: Project direction, resource allocation, timeline planning
- **Review Cycle**: Bi-weekly progress assessment

### Tier 3: Experimental Projects

- **Criteria**: Proof of concepts, learning exercises, exploratory work
- **Context**: Simple directories or notebooks, external project trackers optional
- **Agent Authority**: Quick implementations, research assistance, feasibility analysis
- **Human Authority**: Project viability decisions, learning objectives, exploration priorities
- **Review Cycle**: Monthly viability evaluation

## Resource Allocation Framework

### Time Management

- **Maximum concurrent active projects**: 7 (3 Tier 1, 3 Tier 2, 1 Tier 3)
- **Context switching budget**: 2 hours/week maximum for project transitions
- **Employment boundary**: No personal project work during contracted hours

### Financial Controls

- **Expense tracking**: All project costs logged with category tags
- **Tax implications**: Clear separation of business vs personal development
- **Tool subscriptions**: Centralized billing with project allocation

### Multi-Agent Collaboration Management

#### Human Considerations

- **Employment boundary**: No personal project work during contracted hours
- **Context switching budget**: 2 hours/week maximum for project transitions
- **Cognitive load**: Human capacity and energy constraints recognized

#### Agent Considerations

- **Context efficiency**: Session design optimized for agent context limits
- **Computational patterns**: Agent working preferences and optimal patterns
- **Quality standards**: Agent authority for technical implementation within established patterns

#### Shared Collaboration Protocols

- **Project context switching requires explicit handoff documentation**
- **Context preservation**: Each project maintains dedicated workspace
- **Session optimization**: Balanced for both human and agent effectiveness

## Dependency Resolution Protocol

### Priority Hierarchy

1. **Tier 1 projects always win** resource conflicts with lower tiers
2. **Same-tier conflicts**: Earliest deadline gets priority
3. **Cross-tier dependencies**: Higher tier project can commandeer lower tier resources temporarily

### Blocking Resolution

- **Component needed by multiple projects**: Promote component development to highest requesting tier
- **Developer bandwidth conflicts**: Lower priority project enters hibernation until bandwidth available
- **External dependency blocks**: Affected project health status immediately goes to Yellow, Red if block >2 weeks

### Escalation Process

1. **Day 1**: Identify conflict, document in project logs
2. **Day 3**: Apply priority hierarchy, reallocate if needed
3. **Week 1**: If unresolved, consider project demotion/hibernation
4. **Week 2**: Mandatory strategic review if Tier 1 project still blocked

## Project Lifecycle Management

### Promotion Criteria (Quantitative)

- **Tier 3 → Tier 2**:
  - Minimum 40 hours committed over next 8 weeks
  - Clear deliverable milestones defined
  - No blocking dependencies on other Tier 3 projects

- **Tier 2 → Tier 1**:
  - Revenue potential >$5,000 OR employment-critical designation
  - Stakeholder buy-in confirmed
  - Development infrastructure ready (CI/CD, monitoring)

### Demotion Triggers (Automatic)

- **Any Tier**: <50% planned hours for 3 consecutive weeks
- **Tier 2/1**: Dependency blocking >1 other project for >2 weeks
- **Tier 1**: KPI failure for >4 weeks despite resource adequacy

### Lifecycle Actions

- **Termination**: Failed success criteria after resource reallocation attempt
- **Hibernation**: Temporary pause with clear restart conditions and resource reallocation plan

## Shared Success Metrics

### Collaboration Quality Indicators

- **Context efficiency**: Smooth handoffs between strategic and technical phases
- **Authority respect**: Human and agent domains respected without micromanagement
- **Quality outcomes**: Technical implementation meets strategic objectives
- **Sustainable pace**: Long-term collaboration effectiveness without burnout

### Framework Effectiveness

- **Project velocity**: Faster delivery than single-agent approaches
- **Innovation quality**: Creative solutions emerging from collaboration
- **Adaptation success**: Framework evolution based on usage patterns
- **Multi-stakeholder satisfaction**: Both human and agent needs served
