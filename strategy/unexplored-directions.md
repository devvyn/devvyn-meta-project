        ↓
Each inherits constitutional DNA, develops specialized expertise
        ↓
Cross-project collaboration through standardized interfaces
```

**Value Proposition**:

- **Scalability**: Handle complexity growth through division rather than bloat
- **Specialization**: Each sub-project develops deeper domain expertise

```
Specification Draft Created
        ↓
Distributed to review panel (2-3 agents + 1-2 domain experts)
        ↓
Parallel review with structured feedback templates
        ↓
Revision cycle based on consolidated feedback
        ↓
Approval threshold reached → Implementation authorized
```

**Value Proposition**:

        ↓
Market-clearing price determination (time, priority, resources)
        ↓
Dynamic reallocation based on changing priorities
        ↓
Performance-based reputation affecting future bids
```

**Value Proposition**:

**Value Proposition**:

- **Efficiency**: Avoid reimplementing similar functionality
- **Quality**: Specialized services mature through repeated use
- **Innovation**: Unexpected combinations create new capabilities
- **Sustainability**: Shared maintenance burden reduces individual project overhead

**Implementation Strategy**:

- Phase 1: Identify existing components suitable for extraction
- Phase 2: Create service interface standards
- Phase 3: Build dependency management for cross-project services
- Phase 4: Develop service evolution and versioning protocols

### 5. "Knowledge Graph" Cross-Project Learning

**Concept**: Formal representation of knowledge relationships across all projects
**Academic Precedent**: Scientific knowledge graphs, Wikipedia link structures
**Technical Precedent**: Knowledge bases, semantic web, graph databases

**Implementation Vision**:

```
Each project documents: Concepts, Relationships, Patterns, Outcomes
        ↓
Knowledge graph automatically builds connections
        ↓
Pattern recognition identifies reusable insights
        ↓
Recommendations surface for new projects
        ↓
Cross-project learning accelerates
```

**Value Proposition**:
