# Jupyter Exploration Template

Based on successful exploration patterns from chess-sandbox and Philips Hue API gists.

## Structure for New Technology Exploration

### 1. Introduction Section

- Target audience identification
- Clear success criteria/goals
- Brief overview of what will be demonstrated

### 2. Setup Phase

```python
# Install required packages
%pip install package-name

# Import and basic verification
import package
```

### 3. Discovery Phase

- Find key resources (documentation, APIs, endpoints)
- Test basic connectivity/functionality
- Document any gotchas or surprises

### 4. Systematic Exploration

- Break problem into small, testable pieces
- Build incrementally with verification at each step
- Use intermediate outputs to validate understanding

### 5. Integration/Application

- Apply to real-world use case
- Build toward minimum viable product
- Document learnings and next steps

## Best Practices from Historical Gists

### From chess-sandbox.ipynb

- Clear problem statement and success criteria
- Honest documentation of mistakes and learning
- Step-by-step progression with explanations
- Visual output validation (SVG chess boards)

### From Philips Hue API

- Systematic API discovery approach
- Test each endpoint before moving forward
- Use descriptive variable names and documentation
- Build reusable helper functions early

### General Patterns

- Use f-strings for clear output formatting
- Validate each step before proceeding
- Keep cells focused on single concepts
- Add markdown explanations between code sections
